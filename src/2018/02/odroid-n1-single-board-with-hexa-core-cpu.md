# ODROID-N1 single-board with hexa-core CPU

![odroid_n1](/images/2018/02/n1_01-680x419.jpg)

Today I'll tell you about the new _ODROID-N1_ that will probably come soon and replace the _XU4_, which still sells quite well. You will be interested to know that **it has the power of a cluster with five Raspberry Pi**...

For me, the three companies that are making the Raspberry Pi Foundation a tough competitor are: _HardKernel_ on the one hand with their range of _ODROIDs_, *Shenzhen Xunlong Software CO., which has a lot of versions of *Orange Pi* and *Pine Microsystems Inc.* with relative success thanks to their *Pine64\*.

About its most relevant specifications:

-   Dimensions – 90 x 90 x 20 mm (excluding cooler)

-   SoC Rockchip RK3399 hexa-core processor with a dual-core Arm Cortex-A72@2GHz, a quad-core Arm Cortex-A53@1.5Ghz, and a Mali-T860MP4 GPU.

-   eMMC 5.0 (HS400) flash storage, UHS capable micro-SD slot. Native SATA implementation.

-   Video Output – HDMI 2.0 for 4K display.

-   4Gb DDR3-1866 RAM.

-   Connectivity – Gigabit Ethernet port.

-   USB – 2x USB 3.0 host ports, 2x USB 2.0 host port.

-   Expansion – 40-Pin GPIO port with GPIOs, I2C, SPI, S/PDIF, PWM, ADC, UART, GND, 3.0V, and 5.0V

-   Power Supply – 12V/2A (12V/4A adding two 3.5″ HDD).

I read it has the _Samsung Chromebook Plus_ specifications that cost $450, for about $110, although they are considering a **lite version with the half of RAM and without SATA for $75**.

It seems that the new _SOC RK3399_ will give a lot to talk about, as there are some boards that are mounting it. Some examples: _AAEON RICO-3399 Pico-ITX_, _Firefly-RK3399_, _VideoStrong VS-RD-RK3399_, _Orange Pi RK3399_ and _Pine RockPro64_ among many others.

As Operating System, It runs _Debian Stretch, Ubuntu 18.04 and Android 7.1_. I miss WiFi support, so much in need today. Works with _Linux 4.4LTS kernel_.

It is expected to go on sale in the second quarter of this year. I'll keep you informed.
