# ODROID-N1 single-board with hexa-core CPU

![odroid_n1](/images/2018/02/n1_01-680x419.jpg)

Today I'll tell you about the new *ODROID-N1* that will probably come soon and replace the *XU4*, which still sells quite well. You will be interested to know that **it has the power of a cluster with five Raspberry Pi**...

For me, the three companies that are making the Raspberry Pi Foundation a tough competitor are: *HardKernel* on the one hand with their range of *ODROIDs*, *Shenzhen Xunlong Software CO., which has a lot of versions of *Orange Pi* and *Pine Microsystems Inc.* with relative success thanks to their *Pine64*.

About its most relevant specifications:

* Dimensions – 90 x 90 x 20 mm (excluding cooler)

* SoC Rockchip RK3399 hexa-core processor with a dual-core Arm Cortex-A72@2GHz, a quad-core Arm Cortex-A53@1.5Ghz, and a Mali-T860MP4 GPU.

* eMMC 5.0 (HS400) flash storage, UHS capable micro-SD slot. Native SATA implementation.

* Video Output – HDMI 2.0 for 4K display.

* 4Gb DDR3-1866 RAM.

* Connectivity – Gigabit Ethernet port.

* USB – 2x USB 3.0 host ports, 2x USB 2.0 host port.

* Expansion – 40-Pin GPIO port with GPIOs, I2C, SPI, S/PDIF, PWM, ADC, UART, GND, 3.0V, and 5.0V

* Power Supply – 12V/2A (12V/4A adding two 3.5″ HDD).

I read it has the *Samsung Chromebook Plus* specifications that cost $450, for about $110, although they are considering a **lite version with the half of RAM and without SATA for $75**.

It seems that the new *SOC RK3399* will give a lot to talk about, as there are some boards that are mounting it. Some examples: *AAEON RICO-3399 Pico-ITX*, *Firefly-RK3399*, *VideoStrong VS-RD-RK3399*, *Orange Pi RK3399* and *Pine RockPro64* among many others.

As Operating System, It runs *Debian Stretch, Ubuntu 18.04 and Android 7.1*. I miss WiFi support, so much in need today. Works with *Linux 4.4LTS kernel*.

It is expected to go on sale in the second quarter of this year. I'll keep you informed.
