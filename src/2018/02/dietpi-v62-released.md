# DietPi v6.2 released

![dietpi](/images/2018/02/dietpi.png)

I'm developing several parallel projects at the same time and I don't have much time for the blog. I don't know how often I will be able to write and publish some posts. Maybe it's easier for me to write little news. What do you think?. While you write me in the comments, I'm warning you of the new version of *DietPi* and I highlight some of its improvements...

- - -

* Native PC UEFI | Image now includes options to install to either EMMC (eg: onboard) or SDA (1st HDD) device

* DietPi-Config | Display options > Resolution: Added fkms/kms (OpenGL) modes for RPi 2/3.

* DietPi-LetsEncrypt | On Stretch, added automated Minio certificate renewal. Rerun "dietpi-letsencrypt" on your Stretch system to gain this feature.

* DietPi-Software | AmiBerry: Massive update to v2.14 and SDL2, new installations only. Currently for RPi's under Stretch only, however, we have plans to impliment for other devices. [More info](http://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5&p=64#p64).
