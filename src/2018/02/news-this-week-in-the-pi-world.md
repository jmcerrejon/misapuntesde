# News this week in the Pi World

![rpi_mag](/images/2018/02/rpi_mag.jpg)

This world of development boards surprises me more and more every day. We have so many alternatives and today it's easy to emulate any game console, assemble our industrial and home development box or compete with *Apple's HomePod*, which they keep talking about. We see all this and much more today Friday in the weekly section of **Pi World**.

* **RetroPie: an introduction:** I stopped being a *Retropie* fan a long time ago. I suppose you are trying alternatives that you like more and today there are quite a few, although it was one of the pioneers and never ceases to amaze. What is your current favorite emulator distribution?. | [sirlagz.net](https://sirlagz.net/2018/02/19/retropie-an-introduction/)

* **The DIN rail enclosure solution for Raspberry Pi:** You never know when you're going to need a *shield* box that's connected to the *GPIO* and you can assemble it from sensors to screens.  | [hwhardsoft.de](https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/rasppibox-open/)

![hexapod](/images/2017/07/hexapod.png)

* **Your Electronics Projects, From Concept to Creation:** Open source platform for maker projects much like *Hack A Day*, with projects centered around *Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, home automation* and more. The content is completely user generated still, with new functionality focused on users being able to upload their own projects, as well as comment, collaborate and share with others. | [maker.pro > raspberry-pi](https://maker.pro/projects/raspberry-pi)

![android_empteria](/images/2018/02/android_empteria.png)

* **Industrial Androidâ„¢ with emteria.OS:**  *Android ver. 7.1* for the *Pi3* which can be used for commercial purposes, although they have a *free* version to try. | [emteria.com](https://emteria.com/)

* **ODROID XU4 vs Raspberry Pi 3 - Stress Test, Mining Monero and Network Interface Benchmark:** Let's be honest. These kinds of comparisons are not fair, but it is good to know the potential of these boards and maybe they can be adjusted to our needs in the future. | [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6bZW-2rHgg)

![lakka](/images/2014/11/lakka.png)

* **Lakka-Odroid-XU3/4 With Mainline kernel&gbm/kms mali blobs:** We start with *Retropie* and end with an optimized version of *Lakka* for *ODROID*. I'm not gonna miss this one. It has always work very well even in a *Banana Pi* that I have in the bedroom to play with my daughter the arcade game *Captain Commando*. | [forum.odroid.com](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=98&t=30066#p214707)
