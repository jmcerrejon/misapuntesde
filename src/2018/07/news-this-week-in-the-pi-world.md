# News this week in the Pi World

![commodore64](/images/c64.jpg)

Well, while I'm waiting a couple of weeks for the internet to be set up at home, I have no other way to publish than by going through the open _WiFi_ in the common areas of my urbanization.

We should also mention that the _Copyright Directive_ has been rejected. The worrying thing is that it was only by 40 votes.

Sorry I can not entertain myself to crop and upload the images, but I leave you with more links than usual and that I found more interesting this week in the **Pi World**...
