# News last week in the Pi World

![a500](/images/2018/04/a500.png)

Last Saturday was [World Backup Day](http://www.worldbackupday.com/), and this weekend I have dedicated it to making copies of the copy to avoid the cold sweat when you lose your data. We have become digital dependents of zeros and ones and I tell you one thing: **it's okay** if you lose some data (but just in case...). Now I'm here listening to *Billy Joel* and taking a walk through the most interesting websites I can collect for you about Pi. So make yourself comfortable and enjoy yourself. By the way *Goo.gl* is going to disappear, so I let you on the side panel direct link to the [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eVrAzW4VwIX302o7m4w9TKOzBfJLxRLjbpS1zT0hX4Y/).

* **The MagPi Magazine 68:** In this issue, the main protagonist, of course, is *RPi 3B+*. There are also articles about robots, building a smart fan or some programming with *Python + Minecraft*.| [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/68/)

![retropie_shutdown_button_wiring-1024x677](/images/2018/04/retropie_shutdown_button_wiring-1024x677.png)

* **Raspberry Pi RetroPie Shutdown Button:** It never hurts to remember these kinds of simple tutorials to feel like DIY kings. It's a simple button, don't get cocky when you ride it at home. | [raspberrypi-spy.co.uk](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/03/raspberry-pi-retropie-shutdown-button/)

![ioteeth](/images/2018/04/ioteeth.png)

* **The Internet of Teeth:** Nothing to do with the Pi. Perhaps there will come a day when we can implant a RasPi in a tooth, but this sensor will allow us to dream of a world full of humans with implants to know their health status, where they are at any time or if you have not brushed your teeth for a few days. | [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2018/04/01/the-iot-internet-of-teeth/)

* **Cross Compiling For Raspbian:** There's no need to compile on the Pi and take an hour for it to fail. You can find the first part [here](http://www.get-edi.io/Compiling-for-Embedded-Debian-Target-Systems/). | [get-edi.io](http://www.get-edi.io/Cross-Compiling-for-Raspbian/)

* **No Keyboard, Ethernet & Monitor: Setting up Raspberry Pi in headless Mode:** Well, it's helped me to set up my Pi without having to plug it in via *Ethernet* and other stories when you use a *Raspbian* just installed. | [steinacoz.com](https://steinacoz.com/keyboard-ethernet-monitor-setting-up-raspberry-pi-headless-mode/)

* **An Amiga 500 for the 21st century:** Some of you who have been following me for a long time will know that I always wanted to have an *Amiga 500*. In the end I opted for a *PC/286* and these tutorials make me want to buy one online and see what it can do with a connected Pi. In this tutorial even the floppy drive works. WAit for, you don't know what a floppy drive is? Buff!. | [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2018/03/25/an-amiga-500-for-the-21st-century/)
