# New Recalbox released!

![recalbox](/images/2018/03/recalbox.png)

A couple of days ago the new version of my favorite retrogaming platform was released. As some of you may know, it incorporates *Kodi* and all the emulators you can imagine without having to do anything but burn it in a *microSD* and upload the *ROMs* you want to emulate. Fun is served!. Let's see the most important improvements that have been incorporated in this version...
