# News this week in the Pi World

![thermal](/images/2018/03/thermal.jpg)

This Tuesday something happened to me that made me sad. I posted an article about the new version of _Recalbox_ on the blog and when I wanted to share it in the big _Raspberry Pi_ community on [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/communities/113390432655174294208), I couldn't do it because **I had been banned from the community**. Sometimes I often share my content in that community, but perhaps maybe they would feel bad or I did it on an ongoing basis. I don't know because I don't publish much either, really. You feel frustrated when these things happens, because sometimes I think it has become my duty to report on certain content that are often passed in a world with so many ingenious projects, DIY and _look at what a crack I am and what I have done with my Pi_.

Not all of us are hackers or have enough time to be one, but I can spare time during the week to comment and spread content. I don't make money with the blog as I have said many times and I don't intend to. I even think that I have a sloppy blog and that it needs a facelift **NOW**. But getting back to the subject, I didn't feel part of a community I've loved since I was born and maybe you don't think it's a big deal either, but it hurt.

I tried to remedy it. Once you get kicked out it's impossible to contact the owner, but I saw that _Alex_ from [raspi.tv](https://raspi.tv/) was also the moderator and I was able to contact him via _Hangouts_. He told me it wasn't my fault. Sometimes _Google Plus_ thinks you're _spamming_ and it automatically blocks you. A sigh of relief, my account was unbloqued and I was able to get in. Thank you, _Alex_.

Same day on _Twitter, Mike Horne_ [@recantha](https://twitter.com/recantha), a great community communicator who I think he doesn't like me, retweeted my blog's post. I didn't feel so bad that day. :)

Maybe it's my mind, I don't know, but none of this makes me want to keep keeping you informed about the Pi and other boards and I want to continue doing that in my free time in english and spanish, so here we are another Friday, with your section of the **Pi World**. Thank you for being there.

-   **LibreELEC (Krypton) 8.2.4 MR:** I missed this new version adapted to _Pi 3B+_ that came out last week. Check it out! | [libreelec.tv](https://libreelec.tv/2018/03/libreelec-krypton-8-2-4-mr/)

-   **The ultimate Guide to Raspbian and other Raspberry Pi Software:** An extensive article for the new owners of a _Raspberry Pi_ board where you will learn something of its official operating system called _Raspbian_ and the alternatives available to you. Very complete and well explained. | [eltechs.com](https://eltechs.com/raspbian-and-other-raspberry-pi-software/)

-   **rpix86 frozen until new advise:** Yes, I know it hasn't been updated for at least three years now, but this week I contacted _Patrick_, the developer of the best _x86_ emulator I've used to play the old glories of _MS-DOS_ called [rpix86](https://rpix86.patrickaalto.com/rblog.html), to tell if he was ever going to continue it. Told me that he is working on other projects, but he doesn't rule out working on the emulator again. We're all waiting for you, _Patrick_. Cheer up and keep going!.

-   **Benchmarking the Raspberry Pi 3 B+:** New test bench for the _Pi 3B+_ where we will learn that heat is more distributed at high temperatures and not so much focused on the CPU and how it performs better with each new version they release. | [medium.com](https://medium.com/@ghalfacree/benchmarking-the-raspberry-pi-3-b-plus-44122cf3d806)
