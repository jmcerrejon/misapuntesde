# Still alive!

Well, that's the message you get when we haven't updated our blog in a while. I am overwhelmed in every way: new house, new projects, new work...

This morning I got up and set up the blog to finally make it secure, so it will now be accessible using *SSL*. You can update your bookmarks to []() while I make some changes here. If you see anything unusual, please send me an email or leave a comment below.

For now I check that cookies are not saved when you click OK in the privacy message (arrgh!).

See you soon!
