# News this weeks in the Pi World

![Duke Nukem](/images/2018/09/dukenukem.png)

What a job it's taking to me to write on the blog!. And thanks God I don't have to develop any article. But I'm here again with a summer mix and news of a few weeks ago and this beginning of September. Do you dare to read them?... Here we go with the **Pi World**!

![DietPi](/images/2018/09/dietpi.png)

-   **DietPi v. 6.13:** Updated this distro that I use daily with my _NAS_ with many new features that you can read [here](https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/pull/2011#issue-208266750). By the way, if you have a premium account on a hoster like _Uploaded_, my tutorial to use [plowdown](/post.php?id=239) still works. If you try to install it, you will need _git-core_ and _build-essential_ packages. | [dietpi.com](https://dietpi.com/)

![Lakka](/images/2014/11/lakka.png)

-   **Lakka 2.1.1 with Raspberry Pi 3 B+ support:** It already has support for _Pi 3 B+ and Amlogic S912_ with updates in the libraries and applications it uses, as well as new cores. | [lakka.tv](https://www.lakka.tv/articles/2018/08/12/lakka-211-with-raspberry-pi-3-b-plus-support/)

![Picade](/images/2018/09/picade.png)

-   **Picade:** The guys from _Pimoroni_ have updated the retro arcade machine and it looks more retro and better finished than previous versions. It has a 4:3 screen and all the instructions to mount it without complications. It only needs the slot to insert the coins. | [shop.pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade)

![Step Mania](/images/2018/09/stepmania.jpg)

-   **Stepmania updated to 5.1 Beta 2 for ODROID:** This is one of those games that are played with friends and you end up laughing. Together a _Karaoke_, makes you have the award for best party king. Now it supports _OpenGL renderer_ and adding the _Meverick_ repository, you'll have it available for _Debian Stretch_. | [forum.odroid.com](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=16984)

![POE-Hat](/images/2018/09/poehat.jpg)

-   **The POE HAT:** Or in other words, power your Pi through the _Ethernet_ cable and save another wire. Is it worth it? I don't see it useful unless you have a project that depends on something like that. At least it comes with a fan. For $20... | [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-power-over-ethernet-poe-hat/)

-   **Arduino command line interface:** It seems silly, but I've missed it and we can finally develope using the command line. An _add-on_ for _VSCode_ is already missing. | [github.com > arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli)

![KDE Plasma](/images/2018/09/kde_plasma.png)

-   **KDE Neon Pinebook remix edition RC image:** What's doing here a distro for the _Pine64_? Well, I have one in a drawer and I want to test it. Nothing better than to release it with this version of _KDE+Ubuntu 18.04_. | [forum.pine64.org](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=6443)

![Glances](/images/2018/09/glances.png)

-   **Glances, an Eye on your system:** Fantastic substitute for _htop_ written in _Python_ that will delight everything _sysops_. It is multiplatform, has its own _API_ that you can exploit from other applications and a _WebUI_. | [nicolargo.github.io > glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/)

![Kali](/images/2018/02/kali.png)

-   **Kali Linux 2018.3 release:** You can find it [here](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/) for many boards. | [kali.org](https://www.kali.org/releases/kali-linux-2018-3-release/)

![Mario ANESE](/images/2018/09/anese.png)

-   **ANESE (Another NES Emulator):** I've been reading the curious feature that this emulator has to generate the scroll maps of some _NES_ games. The best thing is to enter the repo to know what I'm talking about. Would you like a port for the Pi? Come on, encourage me in the comments. | [github.com > ANESE](https://github.com/daniel5151/ANESE)

-   **TensorFlow 1.19 compatible with Raspberry Pi:** Check out [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_raspbian) link and if you use _Raspbian 9 Stretch_, you can install it running the next two commands in a Terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
pip3 install tensorflow
```

-   **Duke Nukem: Alien Armageddon 1.0 Released:** ..._You wanna dance_? | [www.moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com/mods/duke-nukem-alien-armageddon)
