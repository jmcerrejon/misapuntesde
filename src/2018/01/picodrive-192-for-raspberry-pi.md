# Picodrive 1.92 for Raspberry Pi

![picodrive_raspbian](/images/2018/01/picodrive_raspbian.png)

Another emulator I've used to compile is the fabulous *Picodrive* that emulates *MegaDrive/MegaCD/32X*.

In this case, it has been used to correct the renamed *GLES* library in *Raspbian Stretch* and all the applications that make use of it, should be doing.

As always, this new version is available by installing [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS) en vuestra *Raspberry Pi*.

I recommend you a game for the *Master System* that was released  at the end of last year called *Silver Valley*. It's like *CastleVania* and you can download it from [here](http://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/SilverValley-SMS).
