# Picodrive 1.92 for Raspberry Pi

![picodrive_raspbian](/images/2018/01/picodrive_raspbian.png)

Another emulator I've used to compile is the fabulous _Picodrive_ that emulates _MegaDrive/MegaCD/32X_.

In this case, it has been used to correct the renamed _GLES_ library in _Raspbian Stretch_ and all the applications that make use of it, should be doing.

As always, this new version is available by installing [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS) en vuestra _Raspberry Pi_.

I recommend you a game for the _Master System_ that was released at the end of last year called _Silver Valley_. It's like _CastleVania_ and you can download it from [here](https://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/SilverValley-SMS).
