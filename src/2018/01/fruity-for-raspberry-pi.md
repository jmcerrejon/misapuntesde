# Fruit'Y for Raspberry Pi

![fruity_screenshot3](/images/2018/01/fruity_screenshot3.png)

Just note that I've added to [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS) this game I didn't know from _Retroguru_ studios. One of those classics to combine fruit of the same kind that is so fashionable and that we already played it in the era of _8/16 bits_. I'll leave you with the video.

To install it, you can do it automatically with [this](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS/blob/master/scripts/games/fruity.sh) script from _PiKISS_.

Let's play!
