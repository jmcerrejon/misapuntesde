* **DietPi v6.0:** If you have to mount a server or need the operating system faster, Debian Stretch-based DietPi is for you. They will soon be releasing a new, highly optimized version. If you already have it installed, you will need to download it again as it will not be updated due to the big changes it has. | [github.com](https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1355#issue-285207849)
