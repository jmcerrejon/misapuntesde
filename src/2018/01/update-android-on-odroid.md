# Update Android on ODROID

![android](/images/2017/11/android.png)

In simpler than it looks, but I couldn't find it. I leave it as a reference...

- - -

* Open the *ODROID Utility* application.

* Press the three point icon at the top right.

* Press *Check online update*.

* Wait for it to download and a message will appear. Click *Proceed* to restart and install the update.

### [ Install GAPPS]

* Access from your Android browser to http://opengapps.org.

* Select ARM for ODROID C1/C2, the version of Android you have (in my case, 6.0) and the micro or pico version. I always choose the one that occupies the least and install less components.

* Once downloaded, we go back to *ODROID Utility*.

* Press the three point icon at the top right.

* Press *Package install from storage*.

* Now choose the file that was previously downloaded from the browser.

* Press *Proceed* and wait for it to restart, install and that's it.
