# Update Android on ODROID

![android](/images/2017/11/android.png)

In simpler than it looks, but I couldn't find it. I leave it as a reference...

-   Open the _ODROID Utility_ application.

-   Press the three point icon at the top right.

-   Press _Check online update_.

-   Wait for it to download and a message will appear. Click _Proceed_ to restart and install the update.

### [ Install GAPPS]

-   Access from your Android browser to https://opengapps.org.

-   Select ARM for ODROID C1/C2, the version of Android you have (in my case, 6.0) and the micro or pico version. I always choose the one that occupies the least and install less components.

-   Once downloaded, we go back to _ODROID Utility_.

-   Press the three point icon at the top right.

-   Press _Package install from storage_.

-   Now choose the file that was previously downloaded from the browser.

-   Press _Proceed_ and wait for it to restart, install and that's it.
