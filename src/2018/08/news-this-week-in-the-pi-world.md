# News this week in the Pi World

![crux](/images/2018/08/crux.jpg)

Summer: What a difficult time to perform any task other than beach, pool and outings with friends!... You can't keep a blog with all this pressure!. I have time now before I go to the pool to turn on the machines and print several links to distribute them around the **Pi World**. Let's go!

* **All Commodore Amiga Games - Every Amiga Game In One Video:** Almost **seven and a half hours** of what it seem to be, all the games on this computer that brings back many memories to me. It has nothing to do with the Pi, but at least you can emulate it without much difficulty with one of them. | [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro9S27OJVgo)

* **Internet of Karaoke Machines:** Adapting an old *Karaoke* machine with a *RPi* is for pros. It would be best to plug the Pi into a TV, a microphone in your hand with some software to get it out to the speaker and it's done. | [blog.crashspace.org](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/07/internet-of-karaoke-machines/)

* **Object detection withh Tensor Flow:** *Rpi + Tensor Flow + Webcam + OpenCV*. What can go wrong? The bad news is, I've yet to find a role for it in any of my projects. I'll have to think more. | [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/31/object-detection-with-tensorflow/)

* **100W Solar panel || DIY or Buy:** Well, you can watch the whole video, but I'll sum it up for you. You'd better buy it and make one yourself. You're welcome. | [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_3gK83bePQ)

* **CRUX-ARM 3.4 released:** *Crux ARM* is a port of a distro called with the same name that tries it in this type of architecture and weighs very little. It is available for the *Pine64, Cubieboard, ODROID XU4 and of course, the Raspberry Pi*, among others. | [crux-arm.nu](https://crux-arm.nu/Documentation/ReleaseNotes3-4)
