# Play ZX Spectrum with Unreal Speccy Portable

![zxspectrum](/images/spectrum_01.jpg)

If you have not ever touched a Spectrum,... Go away from this blog NOW! LOL.

_FUSE_ is another emulator that I always used to play spectrum, but today we will give an opportunity to _Unreal Speccy Portable_. Why?

First because it supports _Z80 128K (Pentagon) AY / YM, Beeper, Beta Disk, Tape, Kempston Joystick / Mouse, Snapshots, Replays._

The supported file formats are: _sna, z80, rzx, tap, tzx, csw, trd, scl, fdi, zip_

You can play on any platform: _Windows / Linux / Mac / Symbian / WinMobile / Dingoo A320/Android/PSP/Raspberry Pi ..._

I do not say more. You have the links below. Just unzip, run the file and... play!
