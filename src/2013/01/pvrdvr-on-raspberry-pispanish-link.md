# PVR/DVR on Raspberry Pi(Spanish link)

It's so hard to find news that are not repeated in the main channels where we all read.

We know that [NetBSD](https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/netbsd) is out, use 3G instead _Wifi_ thanks to [Diverteka](https://www.diverteka.com/?p=959) or the new [OpenELEC 3.0] (https://blog.thestateofme.com/2013/01/26/openelec-3-0-rc2/) has been released.

While I prepare a couple of tutorials about _SSH_ through tablets/phones and recovery data from _Dropbox_ (I've experienced this weekend), the most interesting thing I found is this tutorial to watch and record the contents of a TDT stick connected to the _Raspberry Pi_. So you can watch TV on Raspi or send it via streaming to your _Android_ device.
