# KidsRuby, teach to program to younger people, and now is available to Raspberry Pi.

![kidsruby](/images/kidsruby.jpg)

One of the things that most excited me as a parent is to teach my daughter to program when she grow.

These initiatives are those that lead to the founding creator of the Raspberry Pi, to create a computer for teaching.

Kidsruby is a programming environment for kids. It is available in several languages (including Spanish) and a version for our beloved Raspi is available now.
