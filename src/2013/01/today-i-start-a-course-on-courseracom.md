# Today I start a course on coursera.com

Today we are a lot of online sites to learn, but one is positioning itself as the most prestigious, and can make anyone because it's free.

I start one called programming languages. They have shown how to install *Emacs* and *SML/NJ*. Have a lot of courses organized by category.

They are complex, in English and requires an average of 8 hours a week of dedication. I think that if you want a title you have to pay between 30-100$, but hey!, your CV look cool showing a course from the *University of Washington* ;)
