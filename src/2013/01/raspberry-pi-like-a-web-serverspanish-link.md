# Raspberry Pi like a web server(Spanish link)

![cherokee](/images/cherokee.png)

I've always thought about having my own web server and serve dynamic for a blog, hosting on a RasPi.

_Francois Dion_ has made several test and unfortunately for a blog does not have enough power, but for static web...

Can anyone tell us your experience about host a blog on a _Raspberry Pi_?
