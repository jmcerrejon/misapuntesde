# Android's Notes

![androVSapple_01](/images/androVSapple_01.jpg)

Sooner or later it had to come.

I have an *iPhone* and as some of you know, everything about *Apple*. That does not mean I applaud the efforts made by *Google* for *Android* has become so good (even better) than *iOS*.

I bought one *Android* stick plugged to *TV* via HDMI. It's a cheaper model, but I want to start to take notes of all I'm going to achieve with that.

So I join the club. I hope to share with you experiences and we can meet here to share comments ;)

For now I've put a [link](http://goo.gl/R63lK) on the right sidebar where I'll collect everything I find.
