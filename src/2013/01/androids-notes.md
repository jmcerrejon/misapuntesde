# Android's Notes

![androVSapple_01](/images/androVSapple_01.jpg)

Sooner or later it had to come.

I have an _iPhone_ and as some of you know, everything about _Apple_. That does not mean I applaud the efforts made by _Google_ for _Android_ has become so good (even better) than _iOS_.

I bought one _Android_ stick plugged to _TV_ via HDMI. It's a cheaper model, but I want to start to take notes of all I'm going to achieve with that.

So I join the club. I hope to share with you experiences and we can meet here to share comments ;)

For now I've put a [link](https://goo.gl/R63lK) on the right sidebar where I'll collect everything I find.
