# 2000 visitors in a week!

![contador](/images/counter.jpg)

I have a week with the blog online, and we have already surpassed the 2,000 visitors!.

- - -

The blog seems to be used mainly to put news about *Raspberry Pi* for now. I hope to put quality content in the future, when I meet with less work.

I thank all who have commented, retwitted, emailed to add richer content on this blog, your blog.

I want to show some things I have prepared: a tutorial to watch TV on the *Raspberry Pi* (streaming channel), a contest (WTF!), guidance on programming courses free and paid, and so on. I'm open to any suggestions on my [email](mailto: ulysess@gmail.com).

Thank you!
