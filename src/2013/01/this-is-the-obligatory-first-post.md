# This is the obligatory first post.

If you are here , it means you care one or more of the following: *Raspberry Pi, Apple, Linux or computer application development.*

On this site I'll put Raspberry Pi news , and I'll be gathering interesting things I found about the above themes.

Everybody know me because my Google Docs and you must understand that I do this just for fun, and because I have seen interest from people.

If you want to know something about me, [you can](/about.php).

Tomorrow I'll start with the regular post, and I'll recovering from Google Docs daily news gradually.

As I have not yet implemented a commenting system, you can leave me any questions, encouragement or whatever you can think here: [ulysess@gmail.com](mailto:ulysess@gmail.com)
