# Why Raspberry Pi?

![Raspberry Pi](/images/01_RaspberryPi.jpg)

First because it is impressive that a project that cost created by a few people with some extraordinary skills.

Second because it is so optimized pcb allows you a media center, a download center, a server, your own cloud or recreative game machine in the size of a credit card. Is it not amazing?.

It also allows me to keep in touch with my Linux side, asleep but latent at least. I liked so much that has been the perfect excuse.
