![ThePiHut](/images/ThePiHut.jpg)

The famous web _The Pi Hut_ is launching a series of tutorials, and decided that the first is gonna be How to setup _WIFI_.

The selected operating systems are:

-   Raspbian
-   Debian (Or older versions of Raspbian)
-   Openelec XBMC

I think it will be a very interesting series of posts. Do not miss it from your bookmarks!
