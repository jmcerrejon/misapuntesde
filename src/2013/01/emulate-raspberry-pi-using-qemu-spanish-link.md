# Emulate Raspberry Pi using QEMU (spanish link)

It's unusual to find so many links in Spanish. I see that the Hispanic community is moving quickly, and we are already more than 500 million Spanish speakers in the world.

In this case, the blog indicates a way to emulate the OS *Raspbian* on a *PC* with an application called *QEMU* under *Windows*.
