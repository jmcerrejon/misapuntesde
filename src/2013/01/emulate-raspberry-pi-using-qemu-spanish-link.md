# Emulate Raspberry Pi using QEMU (spanish link)

It's unusual to find so many links in Spanish. I see that the Hispanic community is moving quickly, and we are already more than 500 million Spanish speakers in the world.

In this case, the blog indicates a way to emulate the OS _Raspbian_ on a _PC_ with an application called _QEMU_ under _Windows_.
