# Chromium-OS in stand by to RasPi

Bad news for the community.

*Hexxeh*, the main and active user who was porting the Google operating system to the *Raspberry Pi*, has no time to the project. All is not lost, and he has enough material to continue.

We hope he get time and show us an image one of these days.
