# How to Build a Raspberry Pi File Server (definitive guide)

![server](/images/server.jpg)

One of the things people asked to me by mail is how to build a good file server with Raspi.

Today _Jeremy Morgan_ has made available to everyone a complete guide to share a hard disk or any other device, connected to the Pi.

Thanks Jeremy!
