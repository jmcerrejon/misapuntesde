# EXTRA!: Possible new x86 emulator

![LW2land](/images/LW2land.jpg)

One of the things that attract me from _Raspberry Pi_ was emulation. Unfortunately,_Dosbox_ port it's very slow in most distributions (It's said that on _RISCOS_ works fine).

I got in touch with _Patrick_, developer of one of the best _Nintendo DS_ x86 emulators, to see if it would be possible a port from a86, and this is what he said:

_"Hi!_

_I am currently working on an Android port (called ax86) of my DSx86 emulator, but after I get that done I would like to at least look into porting it to Raspberry Pi as well. I believe much of the stuff I do for Android I can also use with Raspberry Pi, and I would not even need to worry about keyboard and mouse emulation, as I can use the real hardware. :-)_

_So, in short, yes it is possible, and I might start working on it some time in the future."_
