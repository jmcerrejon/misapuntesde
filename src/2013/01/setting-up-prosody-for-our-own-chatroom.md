# Setting up Prosody for our own chatroom

![prosody](/images/prosody.jpg)

_Prosody_ is a server to create chat rooms based on the _XMPP (Jabber)_ protocol. It's used by _Google Talk_ for example, and with these simple steps, we will be able to have our own chat room. Quite useful for clubs, websites or private meetings.
