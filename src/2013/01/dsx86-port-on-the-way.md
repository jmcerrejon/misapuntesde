# DSx86 port on the way

![LW2land](/images/DSx86Animated2.gif)

A few [days](/post.php?id=59) ago I mentioned the possibility of a new port for *Raspberry Pi*. It's purpose is to allow you to run old *DOS* games on your *Nintendo DS* game console. *Patrick* told us that he might start working on it some time in the future.


Well. Its creator was kind enough to get back in touch with me to give me the following news:

*"Hi again!*
 
*Just to let you know, I just today buy a Raspberry Pi. So, the possibility that I will port DSx86 to it increased considerably today. :-)*
 
*Patrick"*

Great News! From here I want to give my full support. Patrick, If you need a beta tester, you can count on me.

Anyway, If someone wants to donate some money to the cause, I leave the link of DSx86 website [here](http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com).
