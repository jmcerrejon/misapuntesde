AEROS is a hybrid distribution of [AROS](http://www.aros.org) and Linux (in the moment debian 6.0 for X86 and 7.0 for ARM is used) available for ARM and x86 systems.

I posted [recently](/post.php?id=202) about this operating system. The bad news was that only allows registered users to download (I think it requires registered user make a small donation).

The good is that it has been released beta 4 to the public, and now we can install applications through the application **lx** included, something we could not to do before.

The new beta is now available as *ARMhf* like *Raspbian* or *Debian Wheezy*.

Who is encouraged to try? After watching the video, we see that the OS goes to the right way.
