Some patches has been applied to improve the experience on *XBMC* distributions.

*Dom Cobley* and *Ben Aviso*n are two gurus on the Pi platform. They both have been working on some improvement on *XBMC*, and the results you can see on the video: smooth movement in the menu and browsing through your media collection is now faster.

Hopefully soon they incorporate this improvements and can better enjoy our media center.
