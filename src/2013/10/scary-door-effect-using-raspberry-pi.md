# Scary Door Effect Using Raspberry Pi

![scary](/images/2013/10/scary.jpg)

Halloween is coming, and with it the children knocking on doors to give them candy. It would be good and funny (to us) scare the neighbors with the next project...

The architect of this cabin is [@Cabe_Atwell](http://twitter.com/Cabe_Atwell), which has managed with some components and patience to design what he calls **Scary Door**.

We hope that children can sleep tonight...
