# Trackers: Review on Raspberry Pi

![music tracker](/images/2013/10/trackers.jpg)

This post has brought me many memories. I want to dedicate it to my friend _Paco Rodr&iacute;guez_ , a great music lover who has decided to compose in the _Raspberry Pi_.

Whether you like to compose or if you've never tried or, why not, you want to listen true masterpieces, keep reading on...

This morning I dedicated to collect information about this possibility and compose your own music. [Trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) allow us to create music with little knowledge of music theory.

The song you hear in the video on these lines belongs to a composition created with a music program called _Tracker_.

As we read in the _Wikipedia Music trackers (usually referred to simply as trackers) are a class of music sequencer software used to create and edit module files; they allow the user to arrange notes (pitch-shifted sound samples from the module) stepwise on a timeline across several (traditionally monophonic) channels._

_Chip Tune_ (as it calls itself now) is the progress of this king of composition. More than once we found a _.S3M _ or _.MOD_ file if you take time playing with computers. It seemed incredible that any guy could compose that way.

I leave you with a list of links if you want to practice and who knows, perhaps in a future you are a master of the _Chip Tune_.
