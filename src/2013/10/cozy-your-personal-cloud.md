# Cozy, your personal cloud

![Cozy](/images/2013/10/cozy.jpg)

I really liked this project, so I am going to comment on what it is.

Cozy is a kind of personal cloud where web hosting applications such as a contact book, web mail client, calendar or chat. You can have it on your _Pi_ and the truth is worth a try.

The list of applications that you can install is quite high, and more are expected. The best thing is that we can try a demo (You have the link below).

Among the apps I liked are the feed reader, calendar, contacts, irc bot, photos and a music player.

Currently available in English and French. This cloud is fully adaptable to any device. As indicated, it could become the center of gravity of your digital life.
