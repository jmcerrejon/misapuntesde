# Minibian 2013-10-13 available

![Minibian](/images/raspflash.jpg)

New updated version of the earlier appeared three months ago that we [did echo]( /post.php?id=216). A few changes to note except the update to *kernel 3.6.11+ #538* and updates pertienentes of her older sister. As features to consider, I would highlight:

- - -
* Fast boot

* Fits on a 1 GB SD card

* Ext4 file system with disabled swap

* Sshd enabled by default

* IPV6

We recall that the user is **root** and password **raspberry**. *raspi-config* not installed by default, but can be fixed with *apt-get install raspi-config*

As a personal note, this version is faster than the previous one.
