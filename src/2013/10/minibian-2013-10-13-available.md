# Minibian 2013-10-13 available

![Minibian](/images/raspflash.jpg)

New updated version of the earlier appeared three months ago that we [did echo](/post.php?id=216). A few changes to note except the update to _kernel 3.6.11+ #538_ and updates pertienentes of her older sister. As features to consider, I would highlight:

---

-   Fast boot

-   Fits on a 1 GB SD card

-   Ext4 file system with disabled swap

-   Sshd enabled by default

-   IPV6

We recall that the user is **root** and password **raspberry**. _raspi-config_ not installed by default, but can be fixed with _apt-get install raspi-config_

As a personal note, this version is faster than the previous one.
