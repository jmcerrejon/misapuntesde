Surveillance systems everywhere!.We have new links with people who are doing a good job in this area...

I collect some [links](/post.php?id=290) about this, which is related, so we will extend to them also in this post.

The **motion** system for those who do not know, activate a function when the camera get an optical response. This means that detects any type of movement and performs an action, such as an image capture or recording a video.

I'll expand the post when I find new links, so keep an eye on this page.
