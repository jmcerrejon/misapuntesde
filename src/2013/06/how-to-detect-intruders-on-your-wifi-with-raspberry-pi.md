# How to detect intruders on your WiFi with Raspberry Pi

![wifi exposed](/images/wifi_exposed.png)

Today is *iOS* and *OSX* Monday, sorry for the *Raspi*, but we have to give prominence to the [World Developers Conference](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) that will tell us what the hell has been involved *Apple* all this time.

While waiting longer, a user has had the detail to send the link to a very interesting post about something that should concern us if we connected our *Pi* to the Internet 24/7. I mean detect intruders in our network. Indispensable. Thanks Nacho for sending me the link.

If you want to know more about this guy, his *Twitter* is [@FresyMetal_com](https://twitter.com/FresyMetal_com).
