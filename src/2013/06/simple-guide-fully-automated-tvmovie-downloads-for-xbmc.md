# Simple GUIDE: Fully Automated TV/Movie downloads for XBMC

![xbmc](/images/xbmc.jpg)

I have a program on the _iMac_ I series automates downloading via _torrent_ automatically when they are ready.

The steps to do it with the _Raspberry Pi_ is a bit longer, but you will the option to download via _torrent_ the series that you like on _XBMC_.
