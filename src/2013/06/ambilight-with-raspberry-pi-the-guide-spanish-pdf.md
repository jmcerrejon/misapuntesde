The main thread in Spanish forums is the *Ambilight*. This Thread is on the top positions every day and everybody wants one: It's cool, easy to make one and finally you can make sense of your Raspi beside your friends.

*Hugo Ruiz* is a frequent user on this blog. We are friends thanks to their comments. Bloggers loves comments, even if to say you like, or if are you going to implement.

This guy sends us the steps you have taken him to build his Ambilight system but ***without Arduino*** like so many tutorials are doing.

From here I thank you for allowing me to publish his work. I hope your comment, man! :)
