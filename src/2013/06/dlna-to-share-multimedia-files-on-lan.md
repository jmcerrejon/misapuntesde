# DLNA to share multimedia files on LAN

![dlna](/images/dlna.jpg)

Every afternoon at lunchtime, I have a problem. My wife wants me to download a TV Film while I'm working on the computer. The process is always the same: download it, search for a pendrive, plug it, copy the TV Film, Search the _USB_ connector behind the _TV_ with skill, play the video.

All this can be done to saving my time, running on my Raspi _DLNA_ service compatible with _SmartTV_ and _AllShare_. Now I download the TV Film, run the _DLNA_ on the Pi and... Done!. _DLNA_ system is also available on mobile devices like _Android_ or _iOS_.

I just read a very clear tutorial explaining how to install it in a few steps on your Pi or any other _Linux_ computer. I really worthwhile.
