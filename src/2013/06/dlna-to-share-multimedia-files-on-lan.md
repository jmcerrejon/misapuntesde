# DLNA to share multimedia files on LAN

![dlna](/images/dlna.jpg)

Every afternoon at lunchtime, I have a problem. My wife wants me to download a TV Film while I'm working on the computer. The process is always the same: download it, search for a pendrive, plug it, copy the TV Film, Search the *USB* connector behind the *TV* with skill, play the video.

All this can be done to saving my time, running on my Raspi *DLNA* service compatible with *SmartTV* and *AllShare*. Now I download the TV Film, run the *DLNA* on the Pi and... Done!. *DLNA* system is also available on mobile devices like *Android* or *iOS*.

I just read a very clear tutorial explaining how to install it in a few steps on your Pi or any other *Linux* computer. I really worthwhile.
