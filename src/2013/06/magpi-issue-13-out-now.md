# MagPi issue 13: out now!

![magpi](/images/magpi13.jpg)

We have a few days the new issue of the magazine ***The MagPi***. From what I've been able to view, there's a contest for you to play a *Raspberry Pi*. We also have an article about making music with *Schism*, *Elite* for *RiscOS*, follow programming with *Scratch* and also continue with the course of *Python*.
