# MagPi issue 13: out now!

![magpi](/images/magpi13.jpg)

We have a few days the new issue of the magazine **_The MagPi_**. From what I've been able to view, there's a contest for you to play a _Raspberry Pi_. We also have an article about making music with _Schism_, _Elite_ for _RiscOS_, follow programming with _Scratch_ and also continue with the course of _Python_.
