# Project with Bluetooth dongle: "Who's home?"

![domotica](/images/domotica_01.jpg)

I always dreamed when I was teenage, enter my own home and that a woman's sultry voice would welcome me and if I have any mail. The reality is much better because it is my daughter who comes running when she hears the door and gives me a hug (the best of the day). For the first one, there is a solution which I detail below.

The project that I found on *instructables.com* is used to enter the house and our *Raspi* run any command using the communication between a bluetooth dongle and a mobile phone.

In this case, It tell you when we enter or leave home, but the possibilities of modifying the script is there. Does anyone dare?.

You have the details in the link below.
