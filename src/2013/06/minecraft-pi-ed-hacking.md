# Minecraft Pi Ed. Hacking

![mcpi hacks](/images/mcpi_hacking.jpg)

**UPDATE:** the link is dead.

I'm not a fan of *Minecraft*. Long time ago I've spent hours in front of my [3D Construction Kit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Construction_Kit) when I was a teen. But it has a great community of fans, and one of you has created a series of *"hacks"* decompiling the binary (Is it legal?) so you can do some things that are not covered.

The Howto is not ended, but updates coming soon.
