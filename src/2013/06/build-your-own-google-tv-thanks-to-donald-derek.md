# Build your own Google TV thanks to Donald Derek

![rpiTV](/images/rpiTV.jpg)

Fantastic _DIY_ for this weekend!

Now I've sold my _AppleTV_, the hardest part is handle with the _SmartTV_, the remote control and the onscreen keyboard.

With this project you can send content from your mobile. It is based on the use of various technologies with success, especially with _Raspbian_ like operating system and various applications such _omxplayer_ or _youtube-dl_ among others and _Chromium_ running in the background.

A little further along, but worth it.
