# Build your own Google TV thanks to Donald Derek

![rpiTV](/images/rpiTV.jpg)

Fantastic *DIY* for this weekend!

Now I've sold my *AppleTV*, the hardest part is handle with the *SmartTV*, the remote control and the onscreen keyboard.

With this project you can send content from your mobile. It is based on the use of various technologies with success, especially with *Raspbian* like operating system and various applications such *omxplayer* or *youtube-dl* among others and *Chromium* running in the background.

A little further along, but worth it.
