# Raspbian Server Edition 2.4

![raspicake](/images/03_RaspberryPi.jpg)

Don't know how he does, but _SirLagz_ stripped _Raspbian_ in a way that few do, in the best sense of the word.

Probably his _Server Edition_ is the most famous to make our Pi connect to the world to serve websites, ftp or whatever comes to mind.

This time has minified the image size from _1 GB_ occupying the _version 2.3_ to a little over **_650 MB_**. It would be nice if someone [donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_AU/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif) some money to the cause.
