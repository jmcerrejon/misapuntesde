# Raspbian Server Edition 2.4

![raspicake](/images/03_RaspberryPi.jpg)

Don't know how he does, but *SirLagz* stripped *Raspbian* in a way that few do, in the best sense of the word.

Probably his *Server Edition* is the most famous to make our Pi connect to the world to serve websites, ftp or whatever comes to mind.

This time has minified the image size from *1 GB* occupying the *version 2.3* to a little over ***650 MB***. It would be nice if someone [donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_AU/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif) some money to the cause.
