# LXDE with Raspberry Pi

![lxde](/images/lxde.png)

My utopia regarding operating system for *Raspberry Pi*, and why not, for desktop, is essential minimal packages needed to start, and nothing else.

I don't use the desktop environment a lot. If you are of those who do not enter in because you think *LXDE* slow, you have an alternative that I always thought would go slow, since *LXDE* always wins in all benchmarks, but apparently not. I talk about *XFCE*. On the next blog gives you simple steps to install it. In *XFCE* everything is easier, I assure you.
