# LXDE with Raspberry Pi

![lxde](/images/lxde.png)

My utopia regarding operating system for _Raspberry Pi_, and why not, for desktop, is essential minimal packages needed to start, and nothing else.

I don't use the desktop environment a lot. If you are of those who do not enter in because you think _LXDE_ slow, you have an alternative that I always thought would go slow, since _LXDE_ always wins in all benchmarks, but apparently not. I talk about _XFCE_. On the next blog gives you simple steps to install it. In _XFCE_ everything is easier, I assure you.
