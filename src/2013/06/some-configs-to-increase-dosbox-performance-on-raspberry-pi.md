# Some Configs to Increase DosBox Performance on Raspberry Pi

![fastdosbox](/images/fastdosbox.jpg)

Over the weekend I like to enjoy some emulators and test/compile some programs (still trying to get some decent karaoke player for the *Pi*).

I always try to get the best performance for an application, and in this case has appeared in my * Twitter timeline* an article to optimize *dosbox or fastdosbox* and play *Dune 2* natively. Enjoy it.
