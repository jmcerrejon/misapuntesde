# Some Configs to Increase DosBox Performance on Raspberry Pi

![fastdosbox](/images/fastdosbox.jpg)

Over the weekend I like to enjoy some emulators and test/compile some programs (still trying to get some decent karaoke player for the _Pi_).

I always try to get the best performance for an application, and in this case has appeared in my _ Twitter timeline_ an article to optimize _dosbox or fastdosbox_ and play _Dune 2_ natively. Enjoy it.
