# Download music from GrooveShark (CLI)

![grooveshark](/images/grooveshark.jpg)

People loves music and loves to accumulate hundreds of thousands of songs on their hard drives. Today we have services like *Spotify* or *GrooveShark* to listen online what we want without having to store them on our HDs...

...but if you are human and you still want to store it, we will see a way to download music from the command line, as the pros likes ;)

You must to download the following code from the *GitHub* repositories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacktheripper51/groove-dl.git
```

We entered the *Python* folder and find the song you like writing **./groove.py 'query'**

Example: ./groove.py 'drive by'
