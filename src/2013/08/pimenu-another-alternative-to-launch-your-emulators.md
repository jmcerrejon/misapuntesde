# PiMenu, another alternative to launch your emulators

![pimame](/images/mame.jpg)

*squid*, the creator of such famous emulators on our platform as *MAME4ALL, PiSNES or PiFBA* now brings us a new launcher for his emulators, but allows you to include other.

By the way, *PiFBA* that try to emulate *CPS1* among others has been updated...

- - -
By default emulators detect emulators downloaded from the *PiStore*, but it is easy to modify the file ***pimenu.cfg*** in the downloaded folder to add yours.

As I said, *piFBA* has been updated to fix a bug. The problem was the keyboard would not work if no joystick was plugged in.
