# PiMenu, another alternative to launch your emulators

![pimame](/images/mame.jpg)

_squid_, the creator of such famous emulators on our platform as _MAME4ALL, PiSNES or PiFBA_ now brings us a new launcher for his emulators, but allows you to include other.

By the way, _PiFBA_ that try to emulate _CPS1_ among others has been updated...

By default emulators detect emulators downloaded from the _PiStore_, but it is easy to modify the file **_pimenu.cfg_** in the downloaded folder to add yours.

As I said, _piFBA_ has been updated to fix a bug. The problem was the keyboard would not work if no joystick was plugged in.
