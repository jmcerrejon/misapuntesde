# Raspberry PIR motion detector

![pir](/images/2013/08/PIR.jpg)

In summer you have to be careful with the house if we go on vacation. My dream has always been to have a robot created by the [OCP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9l9wxGFl4k) who guard the house from thieves.

*Nacho Sanchez* from [fresymetal.com](http://www.fresymetal.com) send us to mail a new article that is sure to interest our readers: A motion detector with *Raspberry Pi*...

He surprise us before with an extraordinary tutorial about [intrusion detection on our network with the Raspberry Pi](/post.php?id=182) and now shows us the steps to put a sensor in the home door and when entering someone can send a message or perform some action.

Thanks for sharing the article, Nacho!
