# Karaoke on Raspberry Pi

![karaoke](/images/karaoke.jpg)

One of the biggest frustrations I've had with the Pi is to be able to use it as _karaoke machine_. I have tried several methods but the guys from _Pi-Fun_ seem to have discovered a way to make it work, but the method is somewhat complex...

The basic problem is to hear the microphone through the _TV_ and play the .kar at the same time. The system failed but now has been updated the sound drivers on _Raspbian_ and seems now it works.

The method requires two _SSH_ connections and install a few packages. Fun is guaranteed.
