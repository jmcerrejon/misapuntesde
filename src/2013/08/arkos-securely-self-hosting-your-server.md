![arkos](/images/arkos.jpg)

*arkOS* is presented as an operating system based on *Arch Linux* with three important premises when hosting your own server: fast, easy and secure.

The functions that can be set when a server operating system are typical: web server, mail, social networking profile and your own file server on the cloud among others. It also lets you easily configure the environment to connect to internet if you have no self-control.

The system has its own control panel called *Genesis* that will allow us to control all aspects of the operating system without having to run any command in the terminal: System Monitor, users, applications with its own repository, plugins ...

I believe without a doubt that if you need you own server, you must choose this solution.
