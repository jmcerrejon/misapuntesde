I'm very excited!.

This post is to say thank you for the visits and the large placement that I am having on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ulysess10) and here...

As you know, this is an ad-free blog which I do not get any economic benefit. My goal has always been to learn, and although I would prefer to spend much more time on this blog, properly preparing a post can take me 1 hour daily perfectly between one thing and another.

I just hope that you continue coming here and comenteis. You know my email, I will resolve the questions you have.

My apologies because my english is not perfect. I try to translate manually each post and sometimes I don't know how to express a phrase or idea. I'll do the best I can.

I have surprises if we reach **100,000 visits**, so I wait impatient and I want, above of all, that you enjoy and learn with this blog.

I hope we keep reading!.
