An interesting proposal of the guys from *howtogeek.com*, a printer always available either in the office or at home.

Installation details in the post. The trick is to use the *Chromium* browser from *Raspbian*. You will need a Google account.

There are many possibilities, such as printing from your mobile device or tablet. You have some interesting links below. Any questions you can resolve it in the comments.
