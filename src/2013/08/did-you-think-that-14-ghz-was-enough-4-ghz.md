Insane. You have to be sick in the head ;)

At that speed is not very stable (it hangs after 10 seconds), but *neo565* has been able even to reach **5 Ghz** (SD card has burnt). Have more details below...

One thing likes to *Overclockers* is reach the limit on any device. It's the common goal.

*neo565* has managed to be stable *24/7* at **2 GHz**. It has used a copper pipe on one end that goes to the CPU. You can see in the next image:

This tube has been filled with refrigerant called difluoroethane (LN2) at first. Tests to exceed 3 Ghz has done with tetrafluoroethane (R-134a, used in air conditioners) getting a temperature of approximately -103 degrees Celsius.
