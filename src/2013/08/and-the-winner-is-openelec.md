# And the winner is... OpenELEC!

![OpenELEC](/images/openelec3.jpg)

Most of us have a mini SD card ready as a media center. Curiously _Raspbmc_ and _Xbian_ always are the new handsome kids on the block. I read daily and I always wonder the same thing: What's wrong with _OpenELEC_? Let's see some info to know what's the best of the best...

_OpenELEC_, the ugly duckling that nobody wants has spread its wings, has faced his brothers and declaring himself like the winner.

_linuxplained.com_ have compared again the latest versions, especially of _Xbian 1.0 Beta 1.1_ (July 14) vs _OpenELEC 3.1.6_ (August 20). The last one has optimized a lot their system.

If you want my personal opinion, I tested these three solutions since I have the Raspi and I always come back to _OpenELEC_. There must be a reason. By the way, What's your favourite distro to use like media center?
