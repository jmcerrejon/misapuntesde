# And the winner is... OpenELEC!

Most of us have a mini SD card ready as a media center. Curiously *Raspbmc* and *Xbian* always are the new handsome kids on the block. I read daily and I always wonder the same thing: What's wrong with *OpenELEC*? Let's see some info to know what's the best of the best...

*OpenELEC*, the ugly duckling that nobody wants has spread its wings, has faced his brothers and declaring himself like the winner.

*linuxplained.com* have compared again the latest versions, especially of *Xbian 1.0 Beta 1.1* (July 14) vs *OpenELEC 3.1.6* (August 20). The last one has optimized a lot their system.

If you want my personal opinion, I tested these three solutions since I have the Raspi and I always come back to *OpenELEC*. There must be a reason. By the way, What's your favourite distro to use like media center?
