# WIFITE: Tool to attack networks WEP, WPA and WPS

![pi hacking](/images/pi_hack.jpg)

I have always been passionate about the issue of security. Both in my development as equipment I own.

If I tell the truth, I think I'm the only man that has ever tried to find out the password of a wireless network.

Today we present **wifite**, a tool to crack *WEP, WPA or WPS networks*...

This tool has been developed in *Python* to run on *Linux* with distros like *Backtrack 5, BlackBuntu, BackBox, or Pentoo!*. This is an auditing tool described as *"set it and forget it"*.

To install on the *Raspberry Pi*, follow the steps indicates by *Borja Lanseros* on his blog.

Have you ever used your Raspi to "recover" the neighbor password?
