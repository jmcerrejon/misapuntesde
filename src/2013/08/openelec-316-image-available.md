# OpenElec 3.1.6 image available

![openelec](/images/xbmc.jpg)

Available a few days ago but has been slow to upload their image. Before the jump to what will be version 3.2 of this great Media Center, I recommend to all fans of this distribution to update. I pass on to detail the reasons...

- - -
* First, boot speed. They have a problem that could slow your boot, and now is completely fixed.

* Speedup fanart and thumbnails loading.

* Network caching.

* GUI optimizations (on RPi showing the Systeminfo output should have much lower CPU usage now).

* Improvements,fixes in Avahi/Zeroconf and Samba.

* OBEX protocol support (Bluetooth) for file transfer.
