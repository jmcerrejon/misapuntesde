# Replace Dropbox with BitTorrent Sync

![bittorrent sync](/images/bittorrent_sync.jpg)

I have recently changed service cloud storage. The 7 GB available in *Dropbox* had I been outgrown. I changed it to [Box](https://app.box.com) and now its 25 GB I haven't got storage problems...

Interestingly I did not think to use the *Raspberry Pi* to store and sync all the files I use most on my computers, whether *PC (Windows, OSX, Linux)*, tablets or mobile phones.

*Jack Minardi* gives us this tutorial to have synchronized the files at any time by the *Raspberry Pi* as a node.

Notice that it has nothing to do with sharing your files in the large network of *torrent* there on the internet, but to use this protocol to keep our files online.
