# Flash Player on the Pi

Now I remember why I bought a *Mac*. These days I've been busy setting up *Ubuntu* on the *Mac* The best thing is that for the first time, almost works, and I say almost because the damn *bluetooth*, which correctly matches the devices (keyboard, mouse and wireless trackpad) on every reboot.

But anyway, my fault. Not much value I have found, so I leave you with a few steps to be able to run *Adobe Flash Player on the Raspberry Pi*, which is that I like it.
