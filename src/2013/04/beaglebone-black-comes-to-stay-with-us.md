# Beaglebone Black comes to stay with us

![BEAGLEBONE](/images/beaglebone.jpg)

It seems that the _Raspberry Pi_ had its moment of glory, and is already looking for another _PCB_ to do more for the same price. _Beaglebone_ has fit some features of your card, and now sell for $45. Is it worth it? Let's see its features...

Took several days looking for interesting information to post on _Raspberry Pi_ and it seems that everything has been exploited already in our Raspi. We do everything with it: emulators, robots, speech synthesizers, home automation, download media center, servers. The possibilities are endless and its usefulness goes beyond a simple desktop computer.

Those who have always opted for a reduced price equipment and the possibilities we have raised, we see in the _Beaglebone_ competent rival.

This new version calls himself _Beaglebone Black_. It come with a _ARM Cortex-A8_ 1GHz processor (_ARMv7 v6_ compared to the _Raspberry Pi_), _512MB DDR3_, _Graphics Accelerator, microHDMI, miniSD_, 2GB of internal storage for the operating system _Angstrom Linux_ among other features.

Those who missed it have a good operating system, we can install _Ubuntu_ (Did not you say good OS?) Or whatever _ARMv7_ compatible, _Android_ included.

For those who like to be in contact with the outside world, has connections to get bored.

They are $10 more than RasPi, but as they say, comes with the power supply and network cable, not to mention the internal memory of 2 GB with [Angstrom Linux](https://www.angstrom-distribution.org/) preinstalled.

Is it worth buying then one [Raspi](https://raspipc.es)? Depends on what you're going to use it. Today we have taken advantage of this pileup to levels that would not have never imagined at first. He still has plenty of life, and will continue in the gap much longer. There is no planned obsolescence, but if you want a half decent desktop environment with a good web browser (yeah, with Flash support) or to run _Android_, _Beaglebone_ is your alternative.
