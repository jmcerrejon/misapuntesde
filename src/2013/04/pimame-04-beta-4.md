Curious that this distribution called _PiMAME_ and we all know, now support more emulators and somewhat neglected which gives it its name, as there is a speed problem in _AdvancedMAME._

This release includes:

-   _Neo Geo_ support with the _GNGeo_ emulator!!! (Full Speed and Audio)
-   _Neo Geo_ roms and bios are stored in the same Roms folder.
-   _Raspbian_ upgraded and updated.
