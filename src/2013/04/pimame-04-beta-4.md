New version of this distribution which now supports more emulators. From here we give *Shea Silverman* Congratulations on your marriage, because he has been married a few weeks ago.

Curious that this distribution called *PiMAME* and we all know, now support more emulators and somewhat neglected which gives it its name, as there is a speed problem in *AdvancedMAME.*

This release includes:

* *Neo Geo* support with the *GNGeo* emulator!!! (Full Speed and Audio)
* *Neo Geo* roms and bios are stored in the same Roms folder.
* *Raspbian* upgraded and updated.
