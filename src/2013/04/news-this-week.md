# News this week...

![rpi](/images/04_RaspberryPi.png)

Well, at last Friday. This weekend we play with our *Raspberry Pi*. I give some ideas to cover news this week have been several blogs.

- - -
* [PiParted v0.03](//sirlagz.net/2013/04/19/piparted-v0-03)

  Distribution from *GParted LiveCD ISO* dedicated as you all know to download and install distros from [Raspberrypi.org](//raspberrypi.org/downloads) (easy method). Size: 149 MB.

* [Rpix86 has logo!](//Rpix86.patrickaalto.com/rblog.html)

   Finally have this great *DOS* emulator logo. Patrick has been busy, but the *MIDI* synthesizer support continues to progress.
 
* [PiMAME 0.6 Beta 5 - Now with PlayStation support!](//Blog.sheasilverman.com/2013/04/pimame-0-6-beta-5-now-with-playstation-support/)

   As you can seen in the video, everything seems to go quite well with the *PSX1* emulator. In the next version will come with a distribution updater not have to be downloaded every time an image.

* [New OpenELEC 3.0.1](//openelec.tv/news/22-releases/88-openelec-3-0-1-released)

   *Frodo 12.1* Updated with corrections for our Raspi among others, several drivers and packages updated in the distro. Full list of changes [here](//github.com/OpenELEC/OpenELEC.tv/compare/3.0.0...3.0.1). Download [here](//resources.pichimney.com/OpenELEC/official_images/OpenELEC-RPi.arm-3.0.1.img.zip)

* [Starting with Arch Linux](//raspberryalphaomega.org.uk/?P=819)

   One of these days I will try this fantastic distro. *Fran Carver* has an article explaining the first contact he had with *Arch Linux* in Raspi.
