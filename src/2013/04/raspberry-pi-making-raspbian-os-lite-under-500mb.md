# Raspberry Pi: Making Raspbian OS Lite (under 500MB)

![raspFlash](/images/raspflash.jpg)

Today is one of those days that excites me. First, today Canonical released a new Ubuntu OS and with a new version I feel like a child to test it on my *iMac*. So today did not bother me, LOL.

Second because the tutorial that I found today is on diet Raspbian distribution for those who do not get into *LXDE* for anything, and we connected our Raspi *Ethernet* cable. These are simple steps, and you lose nothing to try the script that have *element14* forum.
