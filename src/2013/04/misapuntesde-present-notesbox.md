# Misapuntesde present... NOTESbox!

![CUBOpuntes](/images/cubopuntes.jpg)

I have a gift for us!

This is the reason because I have been busy these days. I got the idea of having a *cheat sheet* with information that is always good to have on hand. And to make it look pretty and practical, I present to all the SINGLE NOTES ON A CUBE TO RASPBERRY PI... EL CUBOpuntes! (a.k.a. NOTESbox)

On this unfortunately named *CUBOpuntes* I have compiled some information you will have to consult securely.

But certainly not without faults, so if you see something wrong, a command that does not work, you need that package essential, just let me know. If you have another name for the baby, I'll be watching the comments.

The information gathered:

* Side 1: Logos, schema and GPIO.

* Side 2: Copy OS to SD.

* Side 3: Files you should know and its location.

* Side 4: Useful commands I.

* Side 5: Useful commands II.

* Side 6: Shortcuts keys in the terminal and Favorite apps.

Hope you all like it!

***PS:*** I am not responsible if you stick your fingers with the glue or hurt yourself with the scissors because your lack of experience.
