# Arduino Uno vs BeagleBone vs Raspberry Pi

![ardubeagleraspi](/images/ardubeagleraspi.jpg)

I have a few days between work extreme fighting with _MySQL_ and leisure spending _PAL to NTSC_ audio from _Mac_ to put in a video. Let's see if I can tinker with Raspi, as I have prepared several tutorials that I hope you like them.

I leave you with an article of those where we like to compare these three _monsters_ of the digital age, they are the jewel of microcontrollers.
