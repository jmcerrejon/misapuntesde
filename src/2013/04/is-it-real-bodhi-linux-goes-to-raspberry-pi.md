# Is it real?: Bodhi Linux goes to Raspberry Pi

![Bodhi Linux](/images/bodhy_linux.jpg)

Atention! I just [read](https://plus.google.com/100130971560879475093/posts/aroZf63DNPL) and I don't believe it. _Bodhi Linux_, an _Ubuntu_ based distro, has been ported to _Raspberry Pi_.

I honestly do not believe me just yet (especially being the _April fool's day_). As discussed is quite stable, and completely moving environment with _OpenGL_, so the speed must be amazing.

I think _Raspbian_ now has a serious competitor if all the talk about this is true.

Keep you informed about this great operating system over the week.
