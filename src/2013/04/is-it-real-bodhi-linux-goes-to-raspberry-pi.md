# Is it real?: Bodhi Linux goes to Raspberry Pi

Atention! I just [read](https://plus.google.com/100130971560879475093/posts/aroZf63DNPL) and I don't believe it. *Bodhi Linux*, an *Ubuntu* based distro, has been ported to *Raspberry Pi*.

I honestly do not believe me just yet (especially being the *April fool's day*). As discussed is quite stable, and completely moving environment with *OpenGL*, so the speed must be amazing.

I think *Raspbian* now has a serious competitor if all the talk about this is true.

Keep you informed about this great operating system over the week.
