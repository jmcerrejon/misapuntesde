# Raspberry Pi and GPIO (1)

![gpio](/images/GPIO.jpg)

Probably site [Diverteka](//diverteka.com) is one that has more hispanic fans. Its clean *Wordpress* theme and content so enriching is what motivates us every day to visit their website.

The tutorial presented to us today is known as the great port of our Raspi *GPIO. *GPIO is like that neighbor that we all know but of which we know nothing.

It teaches how the *Raspberry Pi* communicates with the world, the hardware associated with that port, as well as the way *Linux* handles the same, finally managing a card *(XUE-001)* that allows control from a signal *Raspberry* output and one input.

An article to save favorites and keep it in mind.
