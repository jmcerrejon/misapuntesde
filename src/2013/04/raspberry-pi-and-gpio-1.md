# Raspberry Pi and GPIO (1)

![gpio](/images/GPIO.jpg)

Probably site [Diverteka](//diverteka.com) is one that has more hispanic fans. Its clean _Wordpress_ theme and content so enriching is what motivates us every day to visit their website.

The tutorial presented to us today is known as the great port of our Raspi *GPIO. *GPIO is like that neighbor that we all know but of which we know nothing.

It teaches how the _Raspberry Pi_ communicates with the world, the hardware associated with that port, as well as the way _Linux_ handles the same, finally managing a card _(XUE-001)_ that allows control from a signal _Raspberry_ output and one input.

An article to save favorites and keep it in mind.
