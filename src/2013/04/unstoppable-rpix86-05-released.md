![rpix86](/images/DSx86Animated2.gif)

A few days ago version 0.4 released, and would not comment if I get many positive changes in this emulator. If you want to know what new features brings...

- - -

* Fixed EGA palette handling that got broken in the 0.04 version. Sorry!

* Added hardware mouse cursor support in graphics modes.

* Added options to adjust screen overscan values.

* Added (experimental) support for running rpix86 under X Window system.

* Added command line option -a2 to start rpix86 with no audio.

* Added JPO and JPE opcode special handling for [Chess Genius 3](http://www.chessgenius.com/cg3dos/) DOS version by Richard Lang.

* Fixed bugs in several JPO and JPE game-specific opcode handlers.
