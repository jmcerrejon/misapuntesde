# Ubuntu 13.04 on a 27" touch screen

It's amazing how well they have mastered the touch system in the _Ubuntu_ updated operating system that has to go out this month.

I believe that although I have always seen it as a waste of time, since the keyboard and mouse will always be much faster than touching the screen and staining it, are moving in a very positive way with this control system.

If they want to somehow revive repetitive features that are occurring in the operating systems and to copy each other, one will have to uncheck from the rest.

_Ubuntu_ although criticized for decisions that are altering its operating system for better or worse are trying it at least, and I dare say better than _Microsoft_ with their _Windows 8_.

Would you like to control your desktop with your fingers?
