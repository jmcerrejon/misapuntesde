# Raspberry Pi Temperature Control with Expansion Board (translated link)

First of all thanks for the welcome given to the *NOTESbox* (nobody has told me anything about the name, I guess you like). I never received so many hits so far, even with the *RetroPie* guide with which I took a week. It seems that you prefer manual labor, lol.

Well, I just found a very interesting article on a temperature-controlled room with the Expansion Board you can find in this [Store](//www.electroensaimada.com/tienda.html).
