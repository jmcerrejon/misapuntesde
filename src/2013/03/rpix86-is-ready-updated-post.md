# rpix86 is ready! (updated post)

![rpix86](/images/DSx86Animated2.gif)

It's available the first release of this emulator for x86 systems!.

- - -
It is still in beta and has a lot to do. It runs once downloaded typing **rpix86** or **rpix86 -?** for detailed information. To exit, simply press *ESC* or *CTRL-C*

For now only runs on console, so exit the desktop environment and start reminiscing *abandonware* classic.

Thanks Patrick!
