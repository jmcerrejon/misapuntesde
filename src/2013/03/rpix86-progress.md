# rpix86 progress

![rpix86](/images/sysinfo.jpg)

Like I [said](/post.php?id=59) in some moment, we'll have soon a new x86 emulator, for those who wish to run any oldies game or application.

The progress is doing is to match the emulator that already has on _Android_ called [ax86](https://ax86.patrickaalto.com/ablog.html).

From what I read, It will be support directly from the _GPU_ for graphics modes, which is good for the speed issue (now emulate a _80486 20MHz_). One problem is the operating system and their optimizations (we think _Raspbian_). You also have to think that we only have one _CPU_, which must be run all the processes of image, sound, input,...

On his blog you can see a screenshot from the game _Little Big Adventure_.

From here I continue to bet for this emulator, and if you want to donate in any way to the cause, [you can do it](https://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/index.html).
