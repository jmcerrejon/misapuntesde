# RasPlex: New Media Center Distribution

A blog reader called *Hugo Ruiz*, told me days ago we have a new distribution based on *OpenELEC*, but using the *Plex* app, which as many of you know, is an alternative with enough followers to *XBMC.*

It's still in beta, but it works pretty well. Supports *AirPlay* and *AirTunes.*
