# RasPlex: New Media Center Distribution

A blog reader called _Hugo Ruiz_, told me days ago we have a new distribution based on _OpenELEC_, but using the _Plex_ app, which as many of you know, is an alternative with enough followers to _XBMC._

It's still in beta, but it works pretty well. Supports _AirPlay_ and _AirTunes._
