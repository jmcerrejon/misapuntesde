# Free Bunfle: get 9 awesome Mac apps for FREE

![macupdate](/images/macupdate.jpg)

First, let me thank you for the great reception given to the *RetroPie's* guide that I published a [few days ago](/post.php?id=109). The visits have gone through the roof and now I have a daily average of 400 visits. For a blog devoted entirely to something as specific as the *Raspberry Pi* has a special *merit*. Anyway I don't understand how it is possible that *Google Docs* continues to have such popularity and every time I go to the doc I see an average of 10 users online: P


Now I want to write about an offer for Mac. You need to register and you get at your disposal a number of free applications, which otherwise would cost you a bunch of dollars (in this case an average of 130$). If you have a Mac, take advantage.
