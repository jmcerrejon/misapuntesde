# rpix86 version 0.03 released!

![rpix86](/images/rpix86_01.jpg)

Now we can forget *DosBox* forever. This emulator x86 is AWESOME!.

- - -
Download from the web or *Pistore*, uncompress with a game to test (I recommend the [Keen Commander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen) or [Jill of the Jungle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_of_the_Jungle) saga) in the same folder and execute *./rpix86*. Press Y to the question and now you go back 20 years in time and you know the most important commands: *CD folder_name, DIR, CD ..* exit from the folder.

This version contains the following fixes and improvements:

* Improved support for combined keyboard/mouse USB devices (for example Logitech K400)

* Fixed a problem in Mode-X STOSD opcode (fixes "Settlers")

* Implemented read from file directly to EGA VRAM ("Heimdall")

* Fixed SB command DSP_RESET to stop auto-init DMA play ("Doom")
