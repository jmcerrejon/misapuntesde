Download from the web or _Pistore_, uncompress with a game to test (I recommend the [Keen Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen) or [Jill of the Jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_of_the_Jungle) saga) in the same folder and execute _./rpix86_. Press Y to the question and now you go back 20 years in time and you know the most important commands: _CD folder_name, DIR, CD .._ exit from the folder.

This version contains the following fixes and improvements:

-   Improved support for combined keyboard/mouse USB devices (for example Logitech K400)

-   Fixed a problem in Mode-X STOSD opcode (fixes "Settlers")

-   Implemented read from file directly to EGA VRAM ("Heimdall")

-   Fixed SB command DSP_RESET to stop auto-init DMA play ("Doom")
