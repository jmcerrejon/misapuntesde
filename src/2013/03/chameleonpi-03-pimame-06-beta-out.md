# ChameleonPi 0.3 & PiMAME 0.6 Beta out!

![chameleon](/images/chameleon.jpg)

This weekend we have an important mission. No matter the emulator or the game, but the platform.

---

Our case, _Raspberry Pi_ is becoming [one year](https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3375) after launch, a platform for games, media center and very interesting projects.

_ChameleonPi_ it's a _Raspbian_ remix without the X graphical environment that uses it's own launcher to run emulators for old computers, arcades and consoles.

This version brings new features:

-   Added NES emulator

-   Added SNES emulator

-   Support for Joystick

-   Added pdf reader

-   Bug Fixes

The [image](https://chameleon.enging.com/chameleon.v03.img.bz2) is only available this weekend as a direct download.

_PiMAME_ is similar, but mostly just to _MAME_ and more optimized for this system. New of this beta are:

-   Support for the _XArcade Tankstick._

-   New menu at start to choose options before launching emulation.

-   PIP (the Pi IP service) is available to install (but off by default).

-   New admin options in the web frontend to Reboot and Shutdown your Pi.

-   Smaller image should now install on most 2GB cards (with some room to spare).
