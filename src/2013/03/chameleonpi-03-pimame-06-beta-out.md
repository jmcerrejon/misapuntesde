# ChameleonPi 0.3 & PiMAME 0.6 Beta out!

![chameleon](/images/chameleon.jpg)

This weekend we have an important mission. No matter the emulator or the game, but the platform.

- - -
Our case, *Raspberry Pi* is becoming [one year](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3375) after launch, a platform for games, media center and very interesting projects.

*ChameleonPi* it's a *Raspbian* remix without the X graphical environment that uses it's own launcher to run emulators for old computers, arcades and consoles.

This version brings new features:

* Added NES emulator

* Added SNES emulator

* Support for Joystick

* Added pdf reader

* Bug Fixes

The [image](http://chameleon.enging.com/chameleon.v03.img.bz2) is only available this weekend as a direct download.

*PiMAME* is similar, but mostly just to *MAME* and more optimized for this system. New of this beta are:

* Support for the *XArcade Tankstick.*

* New menu at start to choose options before launching emulation.

* PIP (the Pi IP service) is available to install (but off by default).

* New admin options in the web frontend to Reboot and Shutdown your Pi.

* Smaller image should now install on most 2GB cards (with some room to spare).
