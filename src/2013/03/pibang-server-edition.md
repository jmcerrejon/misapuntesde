# PiBang Server Edition

![pibang](/images/pibang.jpg)

The previous post was my 100th post, and I see that every day is more difficult to find updated news about our Raspi. Many blogs have several days without updating, and perhaps means the Pi fever is down. Hopefully not.

We all tend to use either *Raspbian* or *Arch Linux*. Sometimes they do not bother to try other alternatives. Wrong.

PiBang is a good solid distribution now takes a version Server, all command-line based on *Debian* and access to their repos. Also you may be interested in their desktop version that uses *OpenBox* instead of *LXDE*, lighter.
