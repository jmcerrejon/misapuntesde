# OpenELEC 3.0.0 released!

![openelec](/images/openelec3.jpg)

Probably the best distribution for enjoying a good media center with *XBMC*. At least with faster boot times.

It comes with the latest *XBMC 12.1 Frodo* and although available for many platforms, is especially supported for *Raspberry Pi*.

What are you waiting for to try it?
