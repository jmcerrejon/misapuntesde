# OpenELEC 3.0.0 released!

![openelec](/images/openelec3.jpg)

Probably the best distribution for enjoying a good media center with _XBMC_. At least with faster boot times.

It comes with the latest _XBMC 12.1 Frodo_ and although available for many platforms, is especially supported for _Raspberry Pi_.

What are you waiting for to try it?
