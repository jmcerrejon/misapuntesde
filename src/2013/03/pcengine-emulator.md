# PCEngine emulator

![pcengine](/images/PC_Engine_logo.png)

A *Raspberry Pi* forum user put few days ago, a  compiled binary of *PCEngine* emulator. Apparently everything runs perfectly, but no one has left a comment, so I'll put it here to see if anyone is encouraged to test it.

All the information on the second link.
