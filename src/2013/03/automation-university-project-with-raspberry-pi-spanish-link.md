# Automation university project with Raspberry Pi (Spanish link)

![domotic](/images/domotica_01.jpg)

I found a pretty curious post about home automation project that I want to show you. Nothing better than the words from the author about this project to know it:

> *I recently presented a project with the Raspberry Pi in college where I study Computer Science.*
>
> *The goal was pretty generic and was used GPIO pin header that brings the Raspberry Pi and to control the I/O from a mobile device.*
>
> *So for this project I thought of making a model of a home and simulate home automation.*
