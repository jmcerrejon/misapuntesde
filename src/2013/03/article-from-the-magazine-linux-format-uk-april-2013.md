# Article from the magazine Linux Format UK (April, 2013)

![Linux format UK](/images/Linux_Format_UK_2013-04.jpg)

In this magazine we teach various tricks, apps and how to stream and record TV channels through our *Raspberry Pi*. It also teaches several distros to choose the ones you like.

***PS:*** I encourage people to buy the magazine or subscribe to it better.
