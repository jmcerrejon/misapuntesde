# Rapberry Pi: TV record and stream (Spanish link)

![xbmc](/images/xbmc.jpg)

A blog reader of your favourite blog (this, of course) has done us the favor to all Spanish speakers to translate an article from *Linux Format* Magazine. Try to record and broadcast TV channels with a *Raspberry Pi*.

The ingredients: *TDT-USB* receiver, *XBMC* and the plugin *TVheadend.*
