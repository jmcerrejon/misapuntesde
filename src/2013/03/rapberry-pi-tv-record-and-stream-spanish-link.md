# Rapberry Pi: TV record and stream (Spanish link)

![xbmc](/images/xbmc.jpg)

A blog reader of your favourite blog (this, of course) has done us the favor to all Spanish speakers to translate an article from _Linux Format_ Magazine. Try to record and broadcast TV channels with a _Raspberry Pi_.

The ingredients: _TDT-USB_ receiver, _XBMC_ and the plugin _TVheadend._
