# Article from Custom PC UK Magazine (May, 2013)

![Custom PC](/images/PCUK_0513.jpg)

What a coincidence!. I found online an article about _Raspberry Pi_ of the British publication called _Custom PC UK._ Apparently is from May, 2013 (WTF!).

You can read about the following:

-   How to create a case

-   Overclock to 1.1 Ghz

-   Configure a video streaming

Happy reading!

**_PS:_** If you can I encourage people to buy the magazine or subscribe to it better.
