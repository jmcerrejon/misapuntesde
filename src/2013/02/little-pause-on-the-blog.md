# Little pause on the blog

As you can see, I do not update my notes for a days.

My wife has had a delicate operation in which nearly lost his life as she has suffered a brain stroke with 35 years old. Fortunately, thanks to a [arteriography](http://www.cdyte.com/pacientes/glosario/arteriografia/) held in Virgen del Rocio Hospital (Seville, Spain), found three [aneurysms](http:// www.arteriasyvenas.org/index/aneurysms) and closed two. Hopefully in a couple of weeks we stared at home and we can continue to update the blog. 

Thank you!
