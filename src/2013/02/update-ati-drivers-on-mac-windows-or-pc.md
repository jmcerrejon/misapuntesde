# Update ATI drivers on Mac (Windows) or PC

![ati](/images/compo_misa_imac.jpg)

On my iMac I have a partition with *Windows 8* (damn).

Basically I use it to... nothing, maybe play sometimes, and It's difficult to get some updated drivers to test a game or cool benchmarks... until now.

**NOTE:** Also applies to Windows 7 or 8 computers, whether desktop or laptop especially, who are facing more problems.

I found an *ATI* drivers offered to install it without complications. You can also install the *Intel* drivers too if you have it, which is essential today. 

Main advantages:
 
* Always Up-To-Date Drivers.
* No dependency from your official notebook manufacturer.
* Can be installed on clean system i.e. "from scratch" without problems.
* Automated and reliable workaround to install modified drivers - *DSE.*
* Detailed manual, which covers all you need to know about *Leshcatâ€™s driver* sets.
