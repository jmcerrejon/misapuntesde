# Update ATI drivers on Mac (Windows) or PC

![ati](/images/compo_misa_imac.jpg)

On my iMac I have a partition with _Windows 8_ (damn).

Basically I use it to... nothing, maybe play sometimes, and It's difficult to get some updated drivers to test a game or cool benchmarks... until now.

**NOTE:** Also applies to Windows 7 or 8 computers, whether desktop or laptop especially, who are facing more problems.

I found an _ATI_ drivers offered to install it without complications. You can also install the _Intel_ drivers too if you have it, which is essential today.

Main advantages:

-   Always Up-To-Date Drivers.
-   No dependency from your official notebook manufacturer.
-   Can be installed on clean system i.e. "from scratch" without problems.
-   Automated and reliable workaround to install modified drivers - _DSE._
-   Detailed manual, which covers all you need to know about _Leshcatâ€™s driver_ sets.
