On this image You will find the famous _Commodore 64_ emulator _VICE_.

When powering on the RPi there is an automatic login with the user c64 (password c64) and then the emulator is started.

There are some files already installed in the _/home/c64/c64_ folder, split by disk images, tape images and other.
