I like to put on my blog news that you can't find on the normal channels, mostly so that you do not see always the same boring news about *GPIO*, libraries and custom projects: P

I'd like to show you *livarPi*.

*livarPi* lets you build your own *Debian* system on *Raspberry Pi*. It's based on *Raspbian Installer*, is delivered without X server and has several tools:

* cli window manager: dvtm
* file manager: mc & ranger
* editor: nano & vim
* web browser: links2
* mail client: mutt
* irc client: weechat
* media player: omxplayer
* tools: htop & ncdu
* pi administration: raspi-config & ssh
* infos system: "ii" function
