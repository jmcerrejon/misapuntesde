# OpenELEC with steroids by MoDi

![openelec](/images/openelec3.jpg)

*Media Centers* for *Raspberry Pi* is shared between *Raspbmc* and *OpenELEC*. The trouble is that we have to preconfigure certain parameters whenever you install from scratch because of a new version and sometimes is rather bored do this task.

Fortunately, thanks to spanish user *MoDi*, we have a custom OpenELEC build that you will not have to configure, and add at our disposal an *XBMC* overclocked with everything you need to enjoy *streaming*, *BitTorrent* and much more...
