# OpenELEC with steroids by MoDi

![openelec](/images/openelec3.jpg)

_Media Centers_ for _Raspberry Pi_ is shared between _Raspbmc_ and _OpenELEC_. The trouble is that we have to preconfigure certain parameters whenever you install from scratch because of a new version and sometimes is rather bored do this task.

Fortunately, thanks to spanish user _MoDi_, we have a custom OpenELEC build that you will not have to configure, and add at our disposal an _XBMC_ overclocked with everything you need to enjoy _streaming_, _BitTorrent_ and much more...
