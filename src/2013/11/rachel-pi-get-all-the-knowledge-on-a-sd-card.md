# RACHEL Pi: Get all the knowledge on a SD Card.

I had this link saved for review and today I have taken a look.

It is a distribution that act like a server and show to the machines that connect to it from a we browser, various information sources such as *Wikipedia* or the *Khan Academy* courses. All offline and only need a SD card with 32 GB.

RACHEL (**Remote Areas Community Hotspots for Education and Learning**) gives more value to have a *Raspberry Pi* and have it as a server.

It's for schools with few resources where they can't get an internet connection or it's very slow.
