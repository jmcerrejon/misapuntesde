# Synergy: One keyboard and mouse to rule them all

![keyboard](/images/keyboard.jpg)

_Synergy_ is a _client-server_ application that allows us to control with a keyboard and mouse several machines. Imagine you have an _iMac_, a _PC_ and the _Raspberry Pi_. Installing this app allow you to use the keyboard and mouse of one of the teams in all three, so no longer need three keyboards and three mice and save you to keep your desktop clean (which you needs).

This solution is perfect especially for owners of a _Pi_, and it's not difficult at all. Just installed the server program on a desktop computer and the client on the Pi with **sudo apt-get install synergy**

It's explained more clearly in the next blog.
