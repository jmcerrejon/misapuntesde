# EmulationStation + Omxplayer = simple media player

![frontend_omxplayer](/images/2013/11/frontend_omxplayer.jpg)

The truth is that I found this initiative pretty ingenious to get *EmulationStation* as a launcher for the *omxplayer*. Sometimes we do not need *XBMC* if what we do is just watch some movies or listen a music list...

Perhaps it isn't the best choice, since you have to manually create links to each file you have on the file *gamelist.xml* (although you could automate it), but it strikes me that for some project that shows by default a simple media list, it might be just ok.
