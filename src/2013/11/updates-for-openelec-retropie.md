# Updates for OpenELEC & RetroPie

![updates](/images/2013/11/updates.jpg)

Today I would like to thanks the people who contact me by [e-mail](mailto:ulysess@gmail.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ulysess10) for congratulating me on the blog and ask some other things about the *Pi*. Weekly I receive many emails and I try to answer them all.

Today's news is that we have updates from two of our favorite distros: *OpenELEC and RetroPie*...

- - -
The latest version of *RetroPie* 1.9.1 fixed "freezing" bug. Let's remember that changes in version 1.9.0:

* Added emulator Mame4All-RPi & Mupen64Plus-RPi

* Added configuration script to the "splash screen"

* Added configuration menu for RetroArch NetPlay

About *OpenELEC*, currently is under maintenance and I could not access the features of this new version, but you can download in the link I left or you can enable the option "automatic updates" from the *OpenELEC* menu.
