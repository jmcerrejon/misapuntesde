# Wolfram API on Raspberry Pi

![wolfram](/images/2013/11/wolframalpha_logo.jpg)

Seems like yesterday when we reach 100K visits and we exceeded 130K. I'll have to start thinking about what to gift when we reach 200K unique visitors :)

I usually put news that you can't easily find if you daily blogs, but the news I found today is very interesting: *Raspberry Pi Foundation* has announced a partnership with *Wolfram Research* to include *Mathematica* and the *Wolfram language*.

###  [Mathematica]

*Almost any workflow involves computing results, and that's what Mathematica does from building a hedge-fund trading website or publishing interactive engineering textbooks, to developing embedded image-recognition algorithms or teaching calculus.*

We have it in the Raspbian repository and you can install it with **sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wolfram-engine**. It may take about 45 minutes, so be patient. If you don't want to install it, you can try in the next version of *Raspbian*.

I think this will bring a new world of possibilities for our Pi and interesting projects will be born here, so be prepared...
