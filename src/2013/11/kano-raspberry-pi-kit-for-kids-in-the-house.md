# KANO: Raspberry Pi Kit for kids in the house

![kano](/images/2013/11/kano.jpg)

When my daughter has a few more age, I will teach how to program but I don't want she was be a programmer. I think it's the world's sacrificed profession. The kit that I show below is a start to learn not only how to program, but to bring the *Raspberry Pi* to the age for which they were designed.

I'm sure this kit from *Kickstarter* will get financiation before the end of the week (It just starting).

Comes with its own operating system, based on *Raspbian* I guest, with some changes in the graphical environment. Perhaps Santa bring to your child one of those.
