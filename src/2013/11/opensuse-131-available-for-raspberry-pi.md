# OpenSUSE 13.1 available for Raspberry Pi

![OpenSUSE](/images/opensuse.png)

We have available a few days ago the latest version for *openSUSE 13.1*, both for desktop and *Raspberry Pi*. If you want to play around with this distro in your Raspi, let's see some features for you to have in mind...

- - -
* Minimalist.

* It is easier to resize because the root partition is the last one.

* Compressed image is much smaller.

* Reproducible image build, so easy to customize.

* It is armv6 with floating point support, so could be faster.

* Over 5200 successfully built packages from [openSUSE:Factory:ARM](http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv6hl/factory/repo/oss/). If you want to see package changes, here is a [log](http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv6hl/factory/repo/oss/ChangeLog).

* so for example you can install a minimalistic graphical environment with **zypper install xauth twm xorg-x11-server xinit** and start it with **startx**
