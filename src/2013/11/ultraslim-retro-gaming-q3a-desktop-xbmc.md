# UltraSlim: Retro Gaming + Q3A + Desktop + XBMC

![all in one](/images/2013/11/allinone.jpg)

Sorry because lately I'm somewhat involved with many personal projects and some of then for the *Pi*. 

User *Takenover83* present us *UltraSlim*: a minimal version of *Raspbian* to have an **ALL IN ONE OPERATING SYSTEM** loaded with emulators, Quake 3, LXDE and XBMC...

- - -
This is what we get:

* LXDE (minimal desktop with file browser, terminal, netsurf...)

* XBMC - 12.2 Frodo

* VNC

* Tweaks to improve memory usage.

* EmulationStation (boots to this, where you can launch other stuff, like emulators, LXDE, XBMC, etc..)

* Quake III Arena (need to copy the *.PAK* files inside)

* Overclock to 900/450/450/2

* Retroarch with Atari 2600, Sega - Megadrive / Genesis / Sega CD / Mega CD, Nes, SNES, MAME, Playstation and Muppen64plus
