# An index for the MagPi Magazine

![magpiindex](/images/2013/11/magpiindex.png)

We all know *The MAGPI* magazine dedicated to *Raspberry Pi*. We have both in physical and digital format. The problem that I have is that it's difficult to  find an article on it and go looking at 18 numbers is an odyssey, until now...

This link that I put at the end of the post is to put in your favorites. It's a search engine that collects the index of all existing numbers. You can filter by category or search for text in order to obtain the number of the article you want. Do not thank me.

Happy Friday!
