# Introducing SmartBot: Raspberry Pi compatible robot

![smartbot](/images/2013/11/smartbot.jpg)

Everyone may think that the new revolution is 3D printers. I think we forgot something that surely going to explode from NOW. I speak of the world of robotics to anyone.

In this case, having a mobile making "brain" of the beast, you can control a robot with programmable features as discussed below...

The next revolution is called *SmartBot*. It connects to your mobile phone via the audio jack (among others) and to use all the advantages of your mobile device (*GPS, BT, accelerometer*) to control the base presented.

Battle robots, games, learning or using it as a pet. The possibilities are endless and the most interesting is that it is programmable and has its own [SDK](http://www.overdriverobotics.com/SmartBot/smartbot-development-section/smartbot-sdk/). We can build as you will see in the video presentation an *Arduino* or other development board.

It has a programming system based on script. I invite you to visit the website to see all the features we can get. Its cost around 150 euros.

Happy Friday!
