# Week to relax

![lolface](/images/lolface.jpg)

This week I'm quite busy as you can see in the updates rhythm. I started an Android course, I have accumulated a lot of work and I'm studying some C++, so I will update more comfortable the [Google Docs](http://goo.gl/Iwhbq) that is available in the sidebar.

Thanks!
