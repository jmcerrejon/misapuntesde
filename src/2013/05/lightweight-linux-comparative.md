# Lightweight Linux comparative

![Lightweight_Linux](/images/linux_lw.jpg)

Optimized, Optimized, OPTIMIZED!

The best thing about _Linux_ is its variety of flavors, environment and freedom to customize our system. I'm a fan of having a light and fast environment, and this site I present you has a good time thanks to its simple comparative memory consumption.

So you know: unused memory is not wasted memory, but free for what may come.
