# Preconfigured Airplay speaker (Shairport) - Raspberry PI image

![Shairport](/images/shairport.jpg)

Sometimes compiling an application by ourselves can even cause more of a headache. Perhaps it is the case that we do not have much time, and we seek the simplest solution.

In this case, a user has created a _Raspbian_ version of this music server using _AirPlay V 1.0_ protocol running like an _AirPort Express_ station. You can have your entire music collection on a desktop computer, _iGatgets_ or _Android_ and play from _Raspberry Pi_.

It has been tested with [Airfoil (PC/Mac)](https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) and [Honey Player (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rah.airstream&feature=search_result).
