Our friend _Juan_ is right, anyone can assemble a home automation system with a little skill, but if not for this type of articles, we couldn't.

In this case, we are taught to create an _interface_ for our automation projects with [AppInventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/), which will allow us to design applications for mobile devices in an easy way.
