# Fastdosbox speed up dosbox over 250%

![fastdosbox](/images/fastdosbox.jpg)

Like their creator said: *Fastdosbox is a fork of dosbox, based on the sources of dosbox SVN. It brings to Raspbian the dynrec x86 emulation.
In other words a boost of 250% over the official version.*

- - -
Features:

*Speed of a 386DX @ 25Mhz thanks to dynrec x86 emulation.

*Splendid upscaling using dispmanx.

*Based on the sources Dosbox SVN and Dosbox 0.74.

*Between 200% to 250% the speed of Raspbian dosbox v 0.74.

*Console only, no support for X11.

To make it work once installed, go into the game directory and write ***dosbox exec*** where exec is the name of the executable, which is usually a *.EXE*, *.COM* or *.BAT*

The have available for 2.49 euros in the [PiStore](http://store.raspberrypi.com/projects/fastdosbox), which I recommend, or you can download the compiled free version compiled by myself (steps to compile apps was mentioned in [another post](/post.php?id=162)) from this [link](/res/fastdosbox_1.5-1_armhf.deb).
