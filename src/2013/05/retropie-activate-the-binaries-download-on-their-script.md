# Retropie activate the binaries download on their script

Happy Friday! Today I have not slept at all, but I wanna be positive.

The contest I announced earlier this week, I'll have to postpone it until next week. Sorry.

*Petrockblog* has changed the server where he hosted the binaries files, disabled long time ago, and now is active again. With this option, you no longer have to spend eight hours compiling the source code to get the latest version through the script.

It's has been incorporated the 68k Macintosh Emulator [Basilisk II](http://basilisk.cebix.net/).
