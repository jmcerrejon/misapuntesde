# Install RetroPie on BerryBoot 2.0 (spanish pdf)

![berryboot](/images/berryboot.jpg)

We love *RetroPie*, and recently commented that I have several *SD cards*. Many times we miss, because you never will go to fill a *16 or 32 GB SD Card*, so *Berryboot* comes to the rescue to install more than one distribution to a *SD Card*.

A user has been kind enough to share with us a pretty elaborate tutorial to copy *RetroPie* and any other operating system on a *SD Card* with *Berryboot*.

Thanks [Mirror](mailto:mirror.k2@gmail.com) from all of us.
