# PiSNES: Super Nintendo Emulator

![pisnes](/images/snes9x.jpg)

Port based on _SNES9X 1.39_.

This is an old version of _SNES9X_ but was chosen as it runs, mostly, at full speed on the _Raspberry Pi_ unlike the more recent versions of _SNES9X_. Game support is therefore not as good as the newer _SNES9X_ versions and graphics & sound is not as accurate but it plays most popular games very well.

Checkout the _readme.txt_ for more detailed instructions.

The keyboard and joystick can be configured by editing the file **_pisnes/Full/snes9x.cfg_**

Games that will not work, for example, are Yoshi's Island, Street Fighter Alpha 2, Star Fox, Super Mario RPG.
