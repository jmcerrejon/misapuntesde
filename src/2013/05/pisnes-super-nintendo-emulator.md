# PiSNES: Super Nintendo Emulator

![pisnes](/images/snes9x.jpg)

Port based on *SNES9X 1.39*.

This is an old version of *SNES9X* but was chosen as it runs, mostly, at full speed on the *Raspberry Pi* unlike the more recent versions of *SNES9X*. Game support is therefore not as good as the newer *SNES9X* versions and graphics & sound is not as accurate but it plays most popular games very well.

Checkout the *readme.txt* for more detailed instructions.

The keyboard and joystick can be configured by editing the file ***pisnes/Full/snes9x.cfg***

Games that will not work, for example, are Yoshi's Island, Street Fighter Alpha 2, Star Fox, Super Mario RPG.
