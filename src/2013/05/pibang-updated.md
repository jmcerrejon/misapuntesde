# PiBang updated!

![pibang](/images/pibang.jpg)

I always thought that this distro is the eternal forgotten, and it will not be because it's slow.

Today it has just release a new version based on the _Openbox_ variant with _SystemD_ incorporated.

If you want to know more...

In case you do not remember, _PiBang Linux_ is a Linux distribution for _Raspberry Pi_ inspired on _CrunchBang Linux_, and based on _Raspbian_ although with some [differences](https://pibanglinux.org/notes.html).

PiBang Linux is moving to _SystemD_. Please feel free to test it!. Improvements:

-   [SystemD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), because has a faster boot, it is easy to learn, and it still supports initscripts

-   Terminator will be replaced with LXTerminal

-   XCompmgr will be replaced with Compton (gives us better transparancey)

-   First spin of the updated _raspi-config_ utility.

Do not hesitate to try it and tell us your experience.
