# PiBang updated!

![pibang](/images/pibang.jpg)

I always thought that this distro is the eternal forgotten, and it will not be because it's slow.

Today it has just release a new version based on the *Openbox* variant with *SystemD* incorporated.

If you want to know more...

- - -
In case you do not remember, *PiBang Linux* is a Linux distribution for *Raspberry Pi* inspired on *CrunchBang Linux*, and based on *Raspbian* although with some [differences](http://pibanglinux.org/notes.html).

PiBang Linux is moving to *SystemD*. Please feel free to test it!. Improvements:

* [SystemD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), because has a faster boot, it is easy to learn, and it still supports initscripts

* Terminator will be replaced with LXTerminal

* XCompmgr will be replaced with Compton (gives us better transparancey)

* First spin of the updated *raspi-config* utility.

Do not hesitate to try it and tell us your experience.
