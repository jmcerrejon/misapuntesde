I like Ubuntu, I feel comfortable with him on almost all flavors least KDE ([Flame wars!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_%28Internet%29)). Now you have at your disposal my most beloved script for this flavor updated on the lateral bar.

Before we had shared for a group of people and now I make it available for my followers. So here you have it.

Now you can pass from having a heavy slow _Ubuntu_ when you boot the system, who I'm pretty sure will occupy more than 600 MB in memory, to this:
