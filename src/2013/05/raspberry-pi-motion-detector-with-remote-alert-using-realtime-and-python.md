# Raspberry Pi motion detector with remote alert using Realtime and Python

![motion](/images/motiond.jpg)

*Motio*n technology takes years between us. It allows us to perform certain actions upon detecting a change in an image or video.

The tutorial I found seems interesting, and who knows, maybe I make a tutorial about it. Here we discuss _Sergio Costa_ uses [Motion](https://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) as capture engine, and [Realtime](https://www.xrtml.org/) for system messages on the server.
