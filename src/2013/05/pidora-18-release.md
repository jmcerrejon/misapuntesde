# Pidora 18 release

![real_pidora](/images/pidora_fake.jpg)

*Pidora* is a distribution based on *Raspbian* who has changed backgrounds, icons and sounds and now it seems *Dora the Explorer* (hence its name).

Just kidding :P

Pidora is a Linux software distribution for the Raspberry Pi computer. It contains software packages from the Fedora Project (specifically, the Fedora ARM secondary architecture project)...

- - -
Its compiled specifically for the ARMv6 architecture used on the Raspberry Pi packages which have been specifically written for or modified for the Raspberry Pi, and software provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation for device access. 


There are some interesting new features we'd like to highlight:

* Almost all of the Fedora 18 package set available via yum (thousands of packages were built from the official Fedora repository and made available online).

* Compiled specifically to take advantage of the hardware already built into the Raspberry Pi.

* Graphical firstboot configuration (with additional modules specifically made for the Raspberry Pi).

* Compact initial image size (for fast downloads) and auto-resize (for maximum storage afterwards).

* Auto swap creation available to allow for larger memory usage.

* C, Python, & Perl programming languages available & included in the SD card image.

* Initial release of headless mode can be used with setups lacking a monitor or display.

* IP address information can be read over the speakers and flashed with the LED light.

* For graphical operation, Gedit text editor can be used with plugins (python console, file manager, syntax highlighting) to serve as a mini-graphical IDE.

* For console operation, easy-to-use text editors are included (nled, nano, vi) plus Midnight Commander for file management.

* Includes libraries capable of supporting external hardware such as motors and robotics (via GPIO, I2C, SPI).
