# Install Subsonic server in Raspbian

These days hard to find a story that has something of interest to the community.

Well, all you have seen the [camera](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3890) from *raspberrypi's* guys sold out in half a day. It happens like the *Apple's products*: first you buy and then think what you'll use. Too much *hype* I think.

Returning to the subject of the post, the most interesting thing I found in one of my favorite sites is this tutorial to use the *Subsonic* application, which is the same as having *Spotify* but with your music, and accessible from anywhere in the world.

And it's free, as we like.

The idea is to mount a *Java-based* server, download a *.deb* and now from any web browser on the network, access to ***http://ip_raspberry:4040/***

As I've been reading over, have to support video streaming. You may have to check it out in depth. It has [applications](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp) for all platforms.
