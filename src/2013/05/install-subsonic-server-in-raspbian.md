# Install Subsonic server in Raspbian

![subsonic](/images/subsonic.jpg)

These days hard to find a story that has something of interest to the community.

Well, all you have seen the [camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3890) from _raspberrypi's_ guys sold out in half a day. It happens like the _Apple's products_: first you buy and then think what you'll use. Too much _hype_ I think.

Returning to the subject of the post, the most interesting thing I found in one of my favorite sites is this tutorial to use the _Subsonic_ application, which is the same as having _Spotify_ but with your music, and accessible from anywhere in the world.

And it's free, as we like.

The idea is to mount a _Java-based_ server, download a _.deb_ and now from any web browser on the network, access to **_https://ip_raspberry:4040/_**

As I've been reading over, have to support video streaming. You may have to check it out in depth. It has [applications](https://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp) for all platforms.
