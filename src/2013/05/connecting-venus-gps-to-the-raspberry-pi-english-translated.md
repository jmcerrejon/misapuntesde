# Connecting Venus GPS to the Raspberry Pi (english translated)

![gps](/images/GPSChip.jpg)

I do not usually post projects that have to do with GPS or specific hardware, as there are many other blogs about *Raspberry Pi* to talk about it, but I'll make an exception.

Our friend *Mario Gomez* is working on a data logger to store the path of a car ...More than 150 Km/h (93.2 mph)!. For this chip will use *Venus638FLPx-L*.
