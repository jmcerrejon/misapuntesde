# Warranty Services: Farnell

![Raspi_broken](/images/raspi_broken.jpg)

When our Pi or any device under warranty stops working, we always go into a cold sweat and we feel a choking sensation. Then we need to use the warranty service.

I met a user who contacted with me to see if I could solve the problem with their *Raspberry Pi*. At the end he had to use the warranty with the company *Farnell (Spain)*.

In my case I had to use the Apple's warranty service with a *new iPad* when it Home button stopped working and they changed it with a new one.

*Felipe Maza* tells us their story, maybe it can help more than one:

* In the summer of last year I received a *Raspberry Pi* bought in [Farnell](http://www.farnell.com/).

* After 10 months, the last ***May, 6*** my *Raspberry Pi* stop working, after several tests changing cables, cards and so forth, could determine that the *PCB* was not working correctly.

* On ***May, 8*** I write to the technical service *Farnell in Spain* ([link](http://es.farnell.com/jsp/support/support.jsp?formpage=farnell/es_ES/support/webhelp/returnaproduct.jsp)) explaining all the tests I've done.

* The same day *Farnell UK* responds with apologizing that the device fails and give me ***a code*** to attach to the package with *UPS* shipping to pick in the direction they say.

* On ***May, 9*** I give my address.

* The ***May, 10*** *UPS* comes to take my *Rasberry Pi*.

* On ***May, 17*** they issue a refund invoice for the amount of *Raspberry Pi* and shipping charges.

* On ***May, 21*** appear in my account the money, the transaction dated *May , 16*.

Excellent service with *Farnell*. We often forget, especially when we buy products to *China*, what will happen if you device does not work.

Have you had warranty issues with this or another company? Now it's up to you comment.

Thanks to *Felipe* for sharing their experience.
