# Warranty Services: Farnell

![Raspi_broken](/images/raspi_broken.jpg)

When our Pi or any device under warranty stops working, we always go into a cold sweat and we feel a choking sensation. Then we need to use the warranty service.

I met a user who contacted with me to see if I could solve the problem with their _Raspberry Pi_. At the end he had to use the warranty with the company _Farnell (Spain)_.

In my case I had to use the Apple's warranty service with a _new iPad_ when it Home button stopped working and they changed it with a new one.

_Felipe Maza_ tells us their story, maybe it can help more than one:

-   In the summer of last year I received a _Raspberry Pi_ bought in [Farnell](https://www.farnell.com/).

-   After 10 months, the last **_May, 6_** my _Raspberry Pi_ stop working, after several tests changing cables, cards and so forth, could determine that the _PCB_ was not working correctly.

-   On **_May, 8_** I write to the technical service _Farnell in Spain_ ([link](https://es.farnell.com/jsp/support/support.jsp?formpage=farnell/es_ES/support/webhelp/returnaproduct.jsp)) explaining all the tests I've done.

-   The same day _Farnell UK_ responds with apologizing that the device fails and give me **_a code_** to attach to the package with _UPS_ shipping to pick in the direction they say.

-   On **_May, 9_** I give my address.

-   The **_May, 10_** _UPS_ comes to take my _Rasberry Pi_.

-   On **_May, 17_** they issue a refund invoice for the amount of _Raspberry Pi_ and shipping charges.

-   On **_May, 21_** appear in my account the money, the transaction dated _May , 16_.

Excellent service with _Farnell_. We often forget, especially when we buy products to _China_, what will happen if you device does not work.

Have you had warranty issues with this or another company? Now it's up to you comment.

Thanks to _Felipe_ for sharing their experience.
