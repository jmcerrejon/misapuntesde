![RetroPie](/images/2013/03/retrop_01_min.jpg)

We have a new image of our beloved _RetroPie._ In this update we have the following changes:

---

Version 1.5

-   Added emulator gpSP

-   Added emulator SNES9X-RPi

-   Added emulator PiSNES

-   Added GPIO gamepad drivers

-   Updated Emulation Station

-   Updated rpix86

I think it's time to create a new tutorial about this. What do you think?, Have you installed or played RetroPie?.
