# Emulation scene on the Raspberry Pi

![pimame case](/images/pimame_case.jpg)

This week I'll be a little busy, so I might not be able to keep you well informed with fresh news. The result of this will come with two objectives for the *Raspberry Pi* that I have planned and hopefully get them this month. I'm sure you will like it, I promise.

I leave you now with a great post from a user named *welshy* about the current scene in the world of emulation on the *Raspberry Pi*, which collects **ALL** information possible about distributions, installation on your *Raspbian* or compile it from source.
