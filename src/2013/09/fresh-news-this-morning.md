# Fresh news this morning

![raspi](/images/07_RaspberryPi.jpg)

Today is one of those days where you do not find anything particularly interesting to tell about the _Pi_, so I put some news I've been seeing this morning...

---

-   New version of _PiBang! Linux_ already discussed in the past and certainly I would try. It has three variants, but I link to worth: [pibang-openbox-systemd-20130917.img.zip (1.5 GB)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pibang/files/pibang-openbox-systemd-20130917.img.zip/download)

-   I think I have never talked about _Owncloud_, the file server you can install on your _Raspberry_, here a guide to mount it in half an hour: [Private Cloud File Sync with Raspberry Pi under 30 Minutes](https://www.codingepiphany.com/2013/09/15/private-cloud-file-sync-with-raspberry-pi-under-30-minutes/)

-   Update _PiAUISuite_ and [VoiceCommand v3.1](https://stevenhickson.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/voice-control-on-raspberry-pi.html), voice control software: [stevenhickson.blogspot.com.es](https://stevenhickson.blogspot.com.es/2013/09/piauisuite-update-and-voicecommand-v31.html)
