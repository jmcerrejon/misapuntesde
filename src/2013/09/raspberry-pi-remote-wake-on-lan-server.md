# Raspberry Pi Remote Wake-On-LAN Server

![wol](/images/2013/09/wol.png)

I have a problem when turning ON my *PCs* through standard [Wake On Lan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_on_lan): My router does not allow it due to not store the *ARP* tables when a PC is turned OFF, so I can buy another router or use the *Pi* to "wake up" my computers.

Today looking at this possibility, I found the blog of *Jeremy Blum* and he prepared a tutorial a few month ago to realize this mission in a very simple but effective web server and awaken your network equipment through a mobile device.
