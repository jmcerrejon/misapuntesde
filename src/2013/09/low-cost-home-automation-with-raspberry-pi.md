# Low Cost home automation with Raspberry Pi

![rpi domotica](/images/2013/09/domoticalowcost.jpg)

I have not tried much the home automation in the blog, and is one of the things that you can benefit with a _Raspberry Pi_.

Fortunatelly there are tutorials like this from _Enrique Lopez Ma&ntilde;as_ to show us the possibilities we have to make, with little spending money, a control system of lights through relays with the Pi.

Congratulations _Enrique_, You're a crack!
