# Low Cost home automation with Raspberry Pi

![rpi domotica](/images/2013/09/domoticalowcost.jpg)

I have not tried much the home automation in the blog, and is one of the things that you can benefit with a *Raspberry Pi*.

Fortunatelly there are tutorials like this from *Enrique Lopez Ma&ntilde;as* to show us the possibilities we have to make, with little spending money, a control system of lights through relays with the Pi.

Congratulations *Enrique*, You're a crack!
