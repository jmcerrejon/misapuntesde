# cmus music player guide

![cmus](/images/2013/09/cmus.jpg)

One thing I do not usually do much to listen to music on the *Pi*. I didn't find a music player that consume few resources from the terminal until I read this article and I fell in love with **cmus**...

The same thing happened to the author of this article who teach us a little of this amazing audio player including radio playback. To install any more easier to run

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmus
```
