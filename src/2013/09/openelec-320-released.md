# OpenELEC 3.2.0 released!

![OpenELEC](/images/openelec3.jpg)

We have available a new version of the best Mediacenter we can install in our _Raspberry Pi: OpenELEC_ reaches a new stage of maturity and although it focuses on _XBMC Frodo (12.x)_, has some notable changes to note. Do you want to see?...

I'm going to summarize what I consider interesting for our Pi. You can read the rest on the [website](https://openelec.tv/news/22-releases/107-openelec-3-2-0-released):

number of backports from Gotham and **speed improvements for RaspberryPi users**

-   Linux kernel 3.10, bringing many new and updated drivers and improvements

-   ALSA 1.0.27 (thanks to Anssi Hannula for various fixes and improvements)

-   Updated and improved pi firmware (thanks to Dom Cobley)

-   Initial PPTP and OpenVPN support (via connman)

-   Wireless tethering support (on WLAN cards that support it)

-   Completely reworked networking

-   Completely reworked bluetooth with support for more remotes

-   Added support for bluetooth keyboards and file transfers

-   **Boot speed improvements for all platforms (particularly Raspberry Pi)**

-   Many bugfixes and package updates

The most visible change is the new addon settings and the _Wizard_ when you start for the first time to make the first distribution configurations prior to use.

You can upgrade directly from it if you have activated the _auto-update_ or download the new image that you will find here when it comes out.
