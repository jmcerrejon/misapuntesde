# Interesting projects on GitHub: omxd & Ludovision

![streaming](/images/streaming.jpg)

I'm not saying anything new when I commented that *GitHub* has become an endless source where to look interesting projects, regardless of our interests.

Browsing the forums I have seen two that I found interesting to comment to you, and maybe do not know it. Do we see them?...

* omxd: The omxd daemon plays your playlist even if you've disconnected from your
Raspberry Pi, to allow the easy implementation of various media centre apps. That is, everything that passes to */var/run/omxctl*, plays it.

* Ludovision is a web-based remote control for a media server. Simply put, use your phone or tablet and the *Raspberry Pi* to play videos. It runs on *Node.js* and uses *omxplayer* to display videos.
