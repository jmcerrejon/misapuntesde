# RasPyPlayer

![raspyplayer](/images/2013/09/raspiplayer.jpg)

The other day looking for MP3 players for the console, I found this *front-end* written in *Python* to play movies, streaming and music, which is not bad to have something simple.

As a player uses **omxplayer** and has packages for both *Raspbian* to *Arch Linux*.
