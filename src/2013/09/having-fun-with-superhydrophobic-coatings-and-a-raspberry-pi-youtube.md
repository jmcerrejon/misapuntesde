# Having Fun with Superhydrophobic Coatings and a Raspberry Pi (Youtube)

The video that you see on these lines I found most curious. I had never seen act this way a water droplet with a spray.

*hydrophobic* is the fear to water, and in this case from what I understood, the repellent is because the angle of a water droplet exceeds 150 grades and with this compound the surface would have an angle much less.

I wonder what would happen if you cast it in the hair...
