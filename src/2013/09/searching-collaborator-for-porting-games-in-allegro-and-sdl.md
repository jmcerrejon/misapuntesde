# Searching collaborator for porting games in Allegro and SDL

![cs](/images/2013/09/cs.jpg)

Took several days trying to port some games to the *Raspberry Pi*. Something frustrating when everything is almost ready, but some concepts escape you. So if anyone knows these libraries and want to help me, please contact with me.

Thank you!
