# meneamePi, reading news and listening music from Raspberry Pi

![speaker](/images/speaker.jpg)

*Raspberry Pi* came with many purposes, but had never thought that a PCB with the size of a credit card provide to us the facilities it has.

*Joan* show us on his blog a script that play with *mpg123* random songs and interspersed with spoken news from the portal *meneame.net* with *festival* in Spanish.

Thanks *Joan*.
