# 12MB Minimal Image for Raspberry Pi using the Yocto Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/utZpKM7i5Z4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Image created by the prestigious blog [cnx-software](https://www.cnx-software.com/) using _Yocto Project_ tool and explanation of how to create your own distro. What will you get? An image with just **_43 MB_** occupied space and **_20 MB RAM_** used.

Something that I've always liked it every time a new version of _Ubuntu_, customize it to create an _iso_ image with my favorite packages: proprietary drivers, upgraded, essential applications to me... Also did the same with XP and _XPlite_ (Do you remember this application?, What times!).

This is a pending task I had in mind these days after seeing the extraordinary work being done by [@Manel Alonso](https://twitter.com/drkbcn) to _Cubieboard_ with his own distro called [Cubieez](https://www.belinuxmyfriend.com/2013/07/cubieez-debian-para-cubieboard-a10.html). Congratulations!.

The _Yocto Project_ is a platform that will allow us to build an embedded _Linux_ distribution that exactly matches the needs of our projects.

Now I can think about a distribution with no _Scratch_ or graphical environment, or software you will not ever use, lightweight, _XBMC_ and emulators loaded ready to use, with _NFS_ and _Midnight Commander_ of course :P

Do we turn dreams into reality?
