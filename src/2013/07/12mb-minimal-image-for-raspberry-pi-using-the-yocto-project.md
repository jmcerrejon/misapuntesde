# 12MB Minimal Image for Raspberry Pi using the Yocto Project

Image created by the prestigious blog [cnx-software](http://www.cnx-software.com/) using *Yocto Project* tool and explanation of how to create your own distro. What will you get? An image with just ***43 MB*** occupied space and ***20 MB RAM*** used.

Something that I've always liked it every time a new version of *Ubuntu*, customize it to create an *iso* image with my favorite packages: proprietary drivers, upgraded, essential applications to me... Also did the same with XP and *XPlite* (Do you remember this application?, What times!).

This is a pending task I had in mind these days after seeing the extraordinary work being done by [@Manel Alonso](http://twitter.com/drkbcn) to *Cubieboard* with his own distro called [Cubieez](http://www.belinuxmyfriend.com/2013/07/cubieez-debian-para-cubieboard-a10.html). Congratulations!.

The *Yocto Project* is a platform that will allow us to build an embedded *Linux* distribution that exactly matches the needs of our projects.

Now I can think about a distribution with no *Scratch* or graphical environment, or software you will not ever use, lightweight, *XBMC* and emulators loaded  ready to use, with *NFS* and *Midnight Commander* of course :P

Do we turn dreams into reality?
