#  Raspberry Pi Reading Car Diagnostics (OBD-II) Data

I never cease to admire the utilities that people find to this board. I sincerely encouraged to find links for you every day like this that I present below.

I have been surprised this morning when I saw as buying an adapter for less than $25, you can diagnose your vehicle and receive information directly in your Raspi.

[ODB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) is a communication standard for reading data from your vehicle if it is relatively new.

Our friend *Martin O'Hanlon* has developed a *GUI* to read data through this adapter in Python called *pyodb*.

I hope someone is encouraged to try.
