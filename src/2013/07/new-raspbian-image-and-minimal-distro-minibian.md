# New Raspbian image and minimal distro (MINIBIAN)

![flash](/images/raspflash.jpg)

I just read on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rpispy/status/361392771262713856) and it seem to have uploaded a new version of *Raspbian* a couple of days ago. The strange thing is we have no list of updates for any site. Keep looking.

While I have found in forums a new minimal distro called *MINIBIAN*, which optimize the latest *Raspbian* and leaves it with ***189.9 MB*** compressed. The list of improvements below:

- - -

* Kernel 3.6.11+ #474 ARM HF (Hard Float)

* 22 secs boot

* 45 Mb RAM used after boot

* 522 Mb disk space used

* Fit on 1GB SD Card

* Optimized ext4 file system with swap disabled

* Support for both 256Mb and 512Mb version

* Targeted for embedded or server applications (NAS, Web server, electronic applications)

* 100% full compatbile with officiale release

* DHCP client enabled

* SSHD enabled

* root user enabled (default password: raspberry - please change it a.s.a.p.)
