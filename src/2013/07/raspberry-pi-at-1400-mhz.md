# Raspberry Pi at 1400 Mhz!

![raspi hot](/images/04_RaspberryPi.png)

I think the max level I've overclocked the *CPU* has been *950 Mhz.*

It's easy to do without void the warranty on the configuration set in the script *raspi-config* (called [Turbo Mode](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2008)), but there is a brave man who want blow up their *Raspberry Pi* (literally).

A forum user tells us under what conditions his machine has been overclocked to reach this processing speed. Want to see it?...

He tell us in the [forum](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=51119) and did not use any active or passive heatsink. The configuration has been reached so far is:

* ARM: 1400

* GPU: 500

* Core: 550

* SDRAM: 750

* OV: 6

He used PiBang, although I don't think is relevant. Do you encourage to do the same?...

...I knew you not.
