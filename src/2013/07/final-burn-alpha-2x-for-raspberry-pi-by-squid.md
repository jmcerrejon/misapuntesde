Few people remember the [Callus](http://www.retrogames.com/callus.html) *CPS1* emulator that brings titles like *Street Fighter II* with a flawless emulation.

A worthy successors are [Winkawaks](http://cps2shock.emu-france.info/) for *Windows* and *FinalBurn*. Now we have *FinalBurn* available for our *Raspberry Pi*. Are you ready to play *Marvel vs. Capcom*?... Fight!

*Squid*, which has ported to us emulators like [MAME4ALL-pi](https://code.google.com/p/mame4all-pi/) or [pisnes](https://code.google.com/p/pisnes/), surprises us with *Finalburn Alpha X2*. The emulation is perfect and I can't wait to try it :D
