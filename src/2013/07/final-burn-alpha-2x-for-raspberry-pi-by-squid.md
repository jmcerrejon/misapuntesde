<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BB7RufWCxoY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Few people remember the [Callus](https://www.retrogames.com/callus.html) _CPS1_ emulator that brings titles like _Street Fighter II_ with a flawless emulation.

A worthy successors are [Winkawaks](https://cps2shock.emu-france.info/) for _Windows_ and _FinalBurn_. Now we have _FinalBurn_ available for our _Raspberry Pi_. Are you ready to play _Marvel vs. Capcom_?... Fight!

_Squid_, which has ported to us emulators like [MAME4ALL-pi](https://code.google.com/p/mame4all-pi/) or [pisnes](https://code.google.com/p/pisnes/), surprises us with _Finalburn Alpha X2_. The emulation is perfect and I can't wait to try it :D
