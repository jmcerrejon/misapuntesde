# Thank You!

![counter](/images/2013/07/visitors.jpg)

First of all, thank you for the visits yesterday. About 800 visitors in a day is something I'm not ready.

Maintain a blog seems easy but search daily interesting news, images, test, translate,... is hard work without reward.

Also thank you to [raspipc.es](https://raspipc.es/) for supporting the site with your banner. Honestly if you live in Spain and do not want to do your life complicates looking keypads, cases or wires, the best is a pack available on their website. In a day or less you'll have it in your home, not to mention the impeccable service and warranty which [commented earlier](/post.php?id=172).

The supreme gratitude goes to my dear wife and those who comment, retwitt and spread news through this blog.

Now I want to make a stop along the way and discuss a few things that I have prepared for the blog:

Most importantly, minor changes like more buttons to share on social networks. Try to get other content like programming. The [Google Docs](https://goo.gl/Iwhbq) come famous and I am translating into English as people demand. I think it is more successful than this blog :P. In fact I think there is no other document **_ON THE INTERNET_** like that (true story).

And most importantly, a contest. I bought a pair of _Arduinos_ for $9 that I mentioned recently, and that you can get in [this link](https://igg.me/at/9duino/x/4152104).

If you want to join, send articles or want to change something on the blog, you know what to do.

See ya!
