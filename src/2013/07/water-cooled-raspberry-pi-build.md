# Water Cooled Raspberry Pi Build

![water_cooled_01](/images/2013/07/water_cooled_01.jpg)

Interesting mod developed by a user named *wthenshaw* on [overclock.net](http://www.overclock.net) forum.

I have some details and captures after the jump ...

Previously we had seen a liquid cooling heatsink quite successful you can see in [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwc7Hs33cAk).

Now another user ventures to create their own system with components purchased online. I'll keep reporting about this mod.No miss reading!.
