Some time ago withouth info about this *x86* emulator. My dream is that someday emulate *Stonekeep*. Everything will come.

I leave you with the features of this release:

- - -

* Increased mouse cursor movement speed by 4x.

* Added a JPO opcode special handling for NHL '94.

* Added special REP STOSB STD Mode-X version for NHL '94.

* Fixed resetting the active screen page at graphics mode change.

* Fixed text mode palette problem (black screen) in QBASIC.EXE.

* Fixed a key translation table problem with Caps+Shift+Q,W,E,R and T keys.

* Implemented UK keyboard hash key mapping when running under X Window.

* Improved AdLib timer precission for better AdLib detection behaviour.
