# Holidays

![holidays](/images/holidays.jpg)

Well, as you see, I've been away for a vacation los in a village, no internet and only my Raspi, friends, pool and party out of control :P

I programmed a script to post some articles that doesn't worked, and as I turn to go on vacation, I'll update Monday morning until Friday and will not see me here.

Perhaps I tweet something from my [account](https://twitter.com/ulysess10), and you have the [Google Docs](https://goo.gl/Iwhbq) with a list of blogs, so you know what to do while I'm gone ...

See ya in a few days!
