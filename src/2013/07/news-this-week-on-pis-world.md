# News this week on PI's World...

I'm back!

The bad thing is that you come vacation more tired than you leave, at least that's the feeling I get, but I have some ideas that have emerged for the blog. Stay tuned.

Meanwhile. What do you think if we are going over the news that have come to our Raspi this week?

###  mechanical relay control

What I like about *RSPPI* are their funny articles and how well it explains the process for all projects. This time, use a mechanical relay connected to the *Pi* and teaches us to use it.

*Iain Hamilton* has carefully worked to get a home automation and control *Spotify Premium* (*Pandora* on the way), their *Raspberry* and the lights in the house with an elegant and useful *PHP* interface as you can see in the video.

###  Occidentalis 0.2

The guys from *Adafruit* have upgraded their Raspbian based distro with hardware oriented to management *SPI, I2C, one wire and WiFi support* for their products. Only for advanced users like you.

###  C64 emulator

*Shea* promises that in the next release of *PiMAME* will include a *C64 emulator*. Meanwhile a user gives instructions through their forum to install *VICE* on *PiMAME or Raspbian* if you can't wait.

###  Beginner's Guide: choose your development board

We have other PCBs which as you know, they are making a dent in the market. In this article it present some of them.

###  Paula Juiz Blog: Projects come true

I found this profile from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paula_juiz_) by chance, and although his blog has little content, I think we will surprise more than one in the future. For now teaches us to install *Postfix* as a mail server and install a video surveillance system. Good luck Paula!

This is a curious project that caught my attention. It pretend to get the scanning process of old film (*8, 16 and 35mm*) goes out cheaper. The result is amazing as you can see in the video.

![starter kit](/images/2013/07/starterkit.jpg)

In just five days has achieve *Harold Timmis* found his project to create a PCB *Arduino Leonardo's* clone with a cost about $9. Maybe I get any of them. It explains very well in the *indiegogo website* what we will get if we buy one of their boards.

We have new distro based on *Debian Wheezy* with many features that make it interesting: kernel 3.6.11, fits 512 cards or 1 GB, support WIFI dongles, ***login screen in 10 seconds***, ext2,...
