# Hardware Hacking. Lessons for Raspberry Pi (translated)

![hardhacking](/images/2013/07/hardhacking.jpg)


We often find quality content on our *Raspberry Pi*, but from time to time any site stands above the rest. *Hardware Hacking* is starting slowly, but its content is so rich and interesting that I'm dedicating today's post.

- - -
These are the lessons we have now:

* Lesson 0 - Getting the Raspi

* Lesson 1 - Preparing the SD card with the operating system (Windosws and Mac)

* Lesson 2 - First Time Setup

* Lesson 3 - Configuring the GPIO port

* Lesson 4 - Blink LED (LED flashing)

You are not going to be disappointed, even if we think we know almost all of our Pi, you may be surprised with some other information.

In addition, you can find other very interesting articles about *Arduino* and electronics among others.

Good luck to the guys at *Hardware Hacking* and... keep at it!
