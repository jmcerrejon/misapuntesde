# Everything returns to normal

![bug](/images/bug.jpg)

After suffering for two long hours, a problem with the shared hosting company [Zyma Technologics](https://www.zyma.com/), everything returns to normal. Fortunately I do not live from my website's profits and two hours fall in a big company can shake the world. Hopefully it will not be repeated, because everything is so nice when your website works without problems, but when it fails, is when you think to fix some pending issues.

So I will implement a series of improvements on the web this week, before my deserved vacation. So stay tuned if you want to hack this website, sure you have a chance to find some vulnerability and use it.
