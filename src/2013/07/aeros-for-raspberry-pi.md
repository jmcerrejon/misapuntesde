# AEROS for Raspberry Pi

![aeros](/images/aeros.jpg)

While one [native port](http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?viewmode=flat&type=&topic_id=7720&forum=2) of *AROS (Amiga Real Operating System)* continues, here is another project called AEROS pretty interesting.

Want to know more?

*AEROS* is a hybrid distribution between [AROS](http://www.aros.org/) and *Linux(Debian 7.0 for ARM)*. The pity is that this version to our Pi is only for registered users, but you can access a public beta.

Benefits for AROS users of having Linux under the hood:

* more drivers (printers, scanners, NIC, Videocards and more)

* you are able to run every Linux app including Wine (which enables the use of Windows (TM) apps without the need of Windows(TM))

* AROS - Developers can use Linux development tools

* AROS apps can utilize Linux tools to enhance there own functionalitiy.

* Single AROS processes can be forced to run on a single core.

Benefits for Linux users of having AROS on top Linux:

* Fast desktop, maybe the fastest on LInux

* Allows you to run AROS apps and games too, most of them come from Amiga and have a low footprint. You will like how fast they are.

* Allows you to use JanusUAE - an integrated Amiga emulation... classic 68k Amiga apps can be used in coherency mode

As I mentioned, we have a public beta, limited to the option not to install Linux applications. I leave you with it.
