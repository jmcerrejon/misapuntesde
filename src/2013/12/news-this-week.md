# News this week

![EveryDay Practical Electronic](/images/2013/12/every_day.jpg)

This week we had some movement in the Pi World. I have holidays and buying gifts but I've compiled some of them for you. I also just observed that I have exceeded **150K visits** in less time than I expected. Thanks for take into account this blog to keep you inform of news about the Pi. I got news that I can not reveal until January yet, but it will give more international projection to the blog. Let's start with the news...

-   _Raspberry Pi_ has become the "toy" fashion, and many magazines from the electronics sector have regained benefits from articles that talk about it. _EveryDay Practical Electronic_ is one of them. I leave an article from the last number for those who want to see and if you want, purchase. Download: [uploaded.to](https://ul.to/mp82zueo)

-   New _Raspbian, Raspbmc and Arch_ updated images that you can install via _NOOBS_. More information on the official blog. Link: [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5580)

-   Special mention deserves _Raspbian_, which has been updated and some of its features are: new _firmware 3.10 kernel_, _X accelerated driver_ included and enabled by default, _Mathematica_ and _Wolfram language_ installed by default, Scratch and PyPy updated, new _V4L2_ camera driver and package _v4l-utils_ updated. Download: [2013-12-20-wheezy-raspbian.zip](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest)

-   One of the problems we have on the _Pi_ is the limited power it has for web browser. _Midori_ which is the default browser is not the best alternative, but thinking about this someone have been proposed to develop a browser, called **Web** for now, in order to browser according to our _Raspberry Pi_ specifications. For now it is quite unstable, but if you take a chance in the next link you have the instructions to install it. Link: [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5535)
