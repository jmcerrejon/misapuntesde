# News this week

![EveryDay Practical Electronic](/images/2013/12/every_day.jpg)

This week we had some movement in the Pi World. I have holidays and buying gifts but I've compiled some of them for you. I also just observed that I have exceeded **150K visits** in less time than I expected. Thanks for take into account this blog to keep you inform of news about the Pi. I got news that I can not reveal until January yet, but it will give more international projection to the blog. Let's start with the news...

* *Raspberry Pi* has become the "toy" fashion, and many magazines from the electronics sector have regained benefits from articles that talk about it. *EveryDay Practical Electronic* is one of them. I leave an article from the last number for those who want to see and if you want, purchase. Download: [uploaded.to](http://ul.to/mp82zueo)

* New *Raspbian, Raspbmc and Arch* updated images that you can install via *NOOBS*. More information on the official blog. Link: [raspberrypi.org](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5580)

* Special mention deserves *Raspbian*, which has been updated and some of its features are: new *firmware  3.10 kernel*, *X accelerated driver* included and enabled by default, *Mathematica* and  *Wolfram language* installed by default, Scratch and PyPy updated, new *V4L2* camera driver and package *v4l-utils* updated.

* One of the problems we have on the *Pi* is the limited power it has for web browser. *Midori* which is the default browser is not the best alternative, but thinking about this someone have been proposed to develop a browser, called **Web** for now, in order to browser according to our *Raspberry Pi* specifications. For now it is quite unstable, but if you take a chance in the next link you have the instructions to install it. Link: [raspberrypi.org](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5535)
