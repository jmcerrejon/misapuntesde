# Archlinux Ultimate Install

![arh](/images/archpi_5002.jpg)

There was a time, long ago, in which one had time for everything. We spent hours compiling *kernels*, configuring graphics acceleration or installing multiple distros every day.

Today I like to get everything done, and is one of the reasons why I do not fight with * Arch Linux *. I seem to have now found the solution. Check this blog: [n0where.net](http://www.n0where.net/archlinux-ultimate-install-script)
