# Beginning Sensor Networks with Arduino and Raspberry Pi (Ebook)

![ebook](/images/2013/12/beginningsensorN.jpg)

**Beginning Sensor Networks with Arduino and Raspberry Pi** teaches you how to build sensor networks with _Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and XBee_ radio modules, and even shows you how to turn your _Raspberry Pi_ into a _MySQL_ database server to store your sensor data!

---

First you'll learn about the different types of sensors and sensor networks, including how to build a simple _XBee_ network. Then you'll walk through building an Arduino-based temperature sensor and data collector, followed by building a _Raspberry Pi_-based sensor node.

Next you'll learn different ways to store sensor data, including writing to an SD card, sending data to the cloud, and setting up a _Raspberry Pi MySQL_ server to host your data. You even learn how to connect to and interact with a _MySQL_ database server directly from an _Arduino_! Finally you'll learn how to put it all together by connecting your _Arduino_ sensor node to your new _Raspberry Pi_ database server.

If you want to see how well _Arduino_ and _Raspberry Pi_ can get along, especially to create a sensor network, then Beginning Sensor Networks with Arduino and _Raspberry Pi_ is just the book you need.
What you'll learn

-   How to build sensor nodes with both Arduino and Raspberry Pi!

-   What is XBee?

-   What methods you have for storing sensor data
