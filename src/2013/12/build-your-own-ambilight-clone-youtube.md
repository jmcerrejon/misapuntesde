After spending so much time reading about *Raspberry Pi*, I think we are gradually seeing what the majority use is given are: *Media Center, server, emulators for retro systems and Ambilight*.

Today's post is dedicated to the brave who want to learn to build your own *Ambilight system*...

In this first whole process is about assembly of LED strips on the TV and installing *Raspbmc*.

In this second part we configure the necessary files for perfect synchronization between the strips of LEDs and the OS.
