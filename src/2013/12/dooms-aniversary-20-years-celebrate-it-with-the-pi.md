# Doom's Aniversary (20 years). Celebrate it with the Pi

![doom](/images/2013/12/doom-20.jpg)

Many of us have thankfully grown in a time of revolution in video games. There was innovation in programming methods to stand out in an emerging market like _PC_ video games. _Doom_ was the star on the _fps_ genre.

Today we're going to enjoy this game on the Raspberry Pi...

I remember I bought a _Sound Blaster Pro_ to a friend to fully enjoy this game on my _486 DX2 - 100 Mhz_. No one can forget the soundtrack that accompanied us on each stage.

We felt powerful with that shotgun or the chainsaw. The good news is that there have been many _ports_ along the years, and our Pi could not disappoint us.

The best existing version to run on our beloved _Pi_ is _Chocolate Doom_. You can download from the [Pi Store](https://store.raspberrypi.com/projects/chocodoom). This version supports _Dispmanx_ under _SDL 1.2_, using the _GPU_ acceleration to play the game.

Enjoy!.
