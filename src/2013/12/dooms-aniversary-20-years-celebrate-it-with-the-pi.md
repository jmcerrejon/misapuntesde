# Doom's Aniversary (20 years). Celebrate it with the Pi

![doom](/images/2013/12/doom-20.jpg)

Many of us have thankfully grown in a time of revolution in video games. There was innovation in programming methods to stand out in an emerging market like *PC* video games. *Doom* was the star on the *fps* genre.

Today we're going to enjoy this game on the Raspberry Pi...

I remember I bought a *Sound Blaster Pro* to a friend to fully enjoy this game on my *486 DX2 - 100 Mhz*. No one can forget the soundtrack that accompanied us on each stage.

We felt powerful with that shotgun or the chainsaw. The good news is that there have been many *ports* along the years, and our Pi could not disappoint us.

The best existing version to run on our beloved *Pi* is *Chocolate Doom*. You can download from the [Pi Store](http://store.raspberrypi.com/projects/chocodoom). This version supports *Dispmanx* under *SDL 1.2*, using the *GPU* acceleration to play the game.

Enjoy!.
