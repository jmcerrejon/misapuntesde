# Holydays, projects and screen

![Rpi](/images/06_RaspberryPi.jpg)

This week I'll be a little busy and I do not know if I'll have much time to update the blog.

Yesterday I got the *iPad Mini Retina 32GB* and I'll take some holidays *AFK*. I also want to comment a couple of things...

I have started a project in the *Pi*. I hope I can finish before year end. Hope you like it.

I want to encourage Spanish blogs to continue publishing articles, experiences or any links that look interesting to us, since I have seen very little movement in recent months over the blogs I visit.

I also remember that if you need some kind of tutorial that may seem interesting to publish, you can send me a [mail](mailto:ulysess@gmail.com) or contact with me via [twitter](http://twitter.com/ulysess10).

Today I want to show you a link to use *screen*, a window manager in the shell for those who are multitasking like me. ;)
