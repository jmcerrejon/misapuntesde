# Unreal Speccy ZX-Spectrum emulator for Raspberry Pi

![speccy](/images/spectrum_01.jpg)

Today I've compiled the latest version *0.0.86.11* of this awesome emulator using *Raspbian*. I think is one of the best *ZX-Spectrum* emulator. What are you waiting for?...

For your information, *Speccy ZX-Spectrum emulator supports Z80 128K (Pentagon) AY/YM, Beeper, Beta Disk, Tape, Kempston Joystick/Mouse, Snapshots, Replays.*

I didn't forget [ZEsarUX](https://github.com/chernandezba/zesarux), I want to keep an eye more deeply into this soon.

If you want some other alternatives to this emulator, I reviewed some emulators years ago in the post [Review: ZX Spectrum on Raspberry Pi](/post.php?id=788).

There are minor changes for Linux and RPi. In fact, there is no changes since 0.0.83, but the last version I've used was 0.0.64. If you want to know the changes, visit here the [changelog](https://bitbucket.org/djdron/unrealspeccyp/wiki/changelog).

Keys in emulator:

* ESC - menu.

* Arrows, CTRL - joystick.

* F2 - quick save

* F3 - quick load

* F5 - start/stop tape

* F7 - pause

* F12 - reset
