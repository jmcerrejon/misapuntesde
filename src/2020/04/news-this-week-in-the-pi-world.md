# News this week in the Pi World!

![Ubuntu](/images/2020/04/ubuntu-server.png)

It's been a long time since I've spent time in this section that used to be quite regular. I know you miss it, but I stopped seeing so much interesting information and joined the little time I had, it was abandoned until I saw that this week I can make one more post about all the wonderful things that are happening in the Pi World... Let's go!

* **Ubuntu 20.04 SERVER for Raspberry Pi:** Yes, server, because I don't see any *desktop* version out there, although you can install the *ubuntu-desktop* package and everybody's happy. I'm looking forward to starting it up for the first time,... until I saw that there were many services loaded concerning the *Snap* packages and in total 214MB of RAM occupied... I think it's excessive to have a lightweight solutions for the Pi. For now I leave it there "parked", to see if I find some use for this distro.

* **New Raspberry Pi OS Looks Like Windows XP:** I know I'm a little annoying about this *Youtube* channel, but it has everything I like: optimized emulators, you can see your favorite games on the Pi and sometimes show us gifts like this *Raspbian* modified distribution. It's like *WinXP or Win95* based environment for those of us who are nostalgic, and help for run games with Linux X86 architecture. If the channel *ETA Prime* among others are commenting about it, is that this Argentinean guy is doing very well his job. I'll follow his channel very closely, and you should too. I leave you with an article that was dedicated to him in *Toms's Hardware* below. | [tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-raspberry-pi-xp-linux-raspbian-professional)

* **$50 ODROID-C4 Raspberry Pi 4 Competitor Combines Amlogic S905X3 SoC with 4GB RAM:** An upgrade from the *C2* who wants to compete directly with the *RPi 4*. From the benchmarks I see, if you have the *XU4 or the C2* like me, it's not worth the investment. To set up a *NAS* and cryptography it does have very good scores and was a necessary upgrade. Maybe I'll buy one if it generates interest. | [cnx-software.com](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/04/23/50-odroid-c4-raspberry-pi-4-competitor-combines-amlogic-s905x3-soc-with-4gb-ram/)

I leave you with some articles that have been around for a while, but I thought it would be interesting to share them:

* **Network Booting The Pi 4:** Honestly, I've been with a Pi for years and I've never had a chance to try booting an operating system over the network. Now that it's hard to do it from the Pi4, I see the challenge and I'd like to try it out. These are the steps I'm going to take. Are you as excited as I am? | [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/11/network-booting-the-pi-4/)

* **How To Run TensorFlow Lite on Raspberry Pi for Object Detection:** You can use a Pi 3-4. It comes with guides and works with *Raspbian*. Looks pretty easy, don't you think? | [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aimSGOAUI8Y)



 

Happy weekend!
