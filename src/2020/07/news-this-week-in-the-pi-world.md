# News this week in the Pi World!

![lcd](/images/2020/07/lcd.png)

I had taken a few weeks off!. I've had a lot of work this week with [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS). I just missed being a trending topic on Twitter, ha ha. I thank all of you who have supported me, both financially in [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=lPRx0Wb0wZQNE09UXr9-kKhbUILd-dRudtIQKlIt1isACAKVHa1Va6ZxSz4UCFKGB7OstW&country.x=GB&locale.x=GB) where I am receiving donations from users who have found the project very interesting, and those who have spread it through social networks. The article in the prestigious [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/keep-your-raspberry-pi-setup-simple-with-pikiss) has also been an injection of desire to move forward. Now it's time to do my best and get out some new scripts, although there's a lot of old and obsolete code that I'd like to refactor and that gives me a little bit of shame, you know how demanding I am, so I don't get involved anymore. I leave you the links that I have collected this week that are interesting... Here we go!

* **6 SD cards tested. Raspberry Pi 4. Speed test. A1, U1, A2:** I like each and every video from *leepspvideo* (especially the one from [PiKISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gRWM78Ruxs)). Whenever I go to buy a *microSD* card, I have no idea which one to choose. It's usually a *Samsung EVO*, but the *Kingston* are also a clear winner. However, in this video they clear up your doubts. | [youtube.com > leepspvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a8P5m2pWFw)

![discord](/images/2020/07/discord_logo.png)

* **Come to Discord and talk about development, retro gaming and Twister OS!:** *Salva from Pi Labs* along with *Grayduck* have a *Discord* server where we talk about this operating system that's a trend. There we are *ptitSev*, the creator of the project [box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86) to emulate x86 libraries on Pi, and myself where I have my own channel to support *PiKISS*. These days we have been looking at how to create a *dynamic wallpaper* like the one on *MacOS Catalina* for *Raspberry Pi*. You won't be bored, I assure you! | [discord.gg > Pi Labs](https://discord.gg/Y7WFeC5)

![debian](/images/2020/07/debian.png)

* **Raspberry Pi 4, now running your favorite distribution!:** Who needs *Raspberry OS* when you can have *Debian*. The image comes with no extra software, only the compressed image is about *363 MB*. It comes with *kernel 5.7.0-2* and **if you have the RPi 4 8 GB**, you better wait for them to fix a bug with the *USB* ports. | [gwolf.org](https://gwolf.org/2020/07/raspberry-pi-4-now-running-your-favorite-distribution.html)

* **UASP makes Raspberry Pi 4 disk IO 50% faster:** *UASP (USB Attached SCSI Protocol)* is a File Transfer Protocol (It's not FTP!). I didn't know that the one usually used is called *BOT (Bulk-Only Transport)*. This article explains it quite well, although I haven't had time to read it thoroughly. By the way, Jeff's blog is very interesting and worth to have in the bookmarks. | [jeffgeerling.com](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/uasp-makes-raspberry-pi-4-disk-io-50-faster)

* **Writing GUI applications on the Raspberry Pi without a desktop environment:** Of course, using *framebuffer*. It's not the best way to get something that needs speed, but it works. They also comment a library called *Raylib* with many advantages to work with accelerated hardware. | [medium.com](https://medium.com/@avik.das/writing-gui-applications-on-the-raspberry-pi-without-a-desktop-environment-8f8f840d9867)



 

Happy weekend!
