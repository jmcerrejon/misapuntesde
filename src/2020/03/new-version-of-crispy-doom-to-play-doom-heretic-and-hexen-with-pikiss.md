# New version of Crispy Doom to play Doom, Heretic and Hexen with PiKISS

![doom_heretic_hexen](/images/2015/03/doom_heretic_hexen.png)

This morning I woke up wanting to update some script in my **PiKISS project**, and a new version of *Crispy Doom* has been dropped so I can play *Doom, Heretic, Hexen and Strafe* without any complications.

This is the 5.7.1 version that appeared a few days ago and there are so many changes that I better leave the repo for you to take a look.
