# News this week in the Pi World!

![pikiss-abayye](/images/2020/06/pikiss-abayye.png)

Today I updated the blog with the news that are happening, and little by little they are getting together so I can comment them here. I'm also going to be a little busy with new projects, both professional and personal (you'll find out). So I won't make you wait any longer: take off your shoes, disinfect your hands and make yourself comfortable. **Pi World** begins!...

* **New Youtube channel:** Yes, I've been updating my project for several weeks now and I'm going to upload videos to show you how easy it is to install software with [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS). I'll be uploading a couple of videos or three every week. I hope you like it and as the Youtubers say,... **Subscribe to the channel and hit the bell!** | [Youtube > PiKISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4kMqi3hamY&list=PLXhElW3ALmWh8p0mn1ZECawkKyF8QzNNP)

* **Boot from USB with Raspberry Pi 4 goes stable:**: We've seen many guides to this already. In my personal experience, from a simple *USB* pendrive I have had no problems, but an *SSD* needing more power, it has been impossible to make it work unless you have a hub with a power adapter. Important to download the files from the */boot* directory on [this branch](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/a6c9b6b48ce86ef2527586a50760d52f1b33f642) and copy it to your */boot*. I even made a script on *macOS* to automate everything.

* **Pinn OS updated:** PINN is an enhancement of *NOOBS*. It's a multi OS loader and now supports **USB boot from Raspberry Pi 4**. | [sourceforge.net > pinn](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pinn/)

![magpi.png](/images/2020/06/magpi.png)

* **The MagPi - Issue 95:** With interesting articles as always: Build your own game console, build an MS-DOS emulator with DOSBox-X, Piano-Playing Robot,...  | [magpi.raspberrypi.org](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/issues/95)

![twisteros.png](/images/2020/06/twisteros.png)

* **Twister OS Version 1.2 Update:** Fixed an issue where the "Contacts" app would not appear in the application menu, replaced the login screen for the *Nighthawk* theme with a new one that can scale to different display resolutions, updated the login screen for the *iRaspbian* theme, replaced the *Slingscold* application launcher with *LightPad*, which fixes an issue with launching terminal-based apps and updated the *README*. | [raspbian-x.com](https://raspbian-x.com/)

![mkvtoolnix.png](/images/2020/06/mkvtoolnix.png)

* **MKVToolNix - Matroska tools for Raspberry Pi OS:** I can't believe this  *mkv* Swiss army knife is available for *Raspberry OS*. It even has its own repository. | [mkvtoolnix.download](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html#raspbian)

![DOSBian.jpg](/images/2020/06/DOSBian.jpg)

* **Dosbian, A 486DX machine in the palm of your hand:** *Dosbian* is the first *Raspberry Pi* distro totally dedicated to the *DOS* world. It boots straight to *Dosbox*, from there, you can install whatever you want and building your retro-pc. | [cmaiolino.wordpress.com/dosbian](https://cmaiolino.wordpress.com/dosbian/)

* **Digital RPi LED Thermometer:** Instructions on how to assemble a beautiful thermometer for your salon using a *Raspberry Pi Zero W*. | [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/Digital-RPi-LED-Thermometer/)



 

Happy weekend!
