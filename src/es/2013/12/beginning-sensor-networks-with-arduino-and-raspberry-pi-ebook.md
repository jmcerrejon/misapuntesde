# Beginning Sensor Networks with Arduino and Raspberry Pi (Ebook)

![ebook](/images/2013/12/beginningsensorN.jpg)

**Beginning Sensor Networks with Arduino and Raspberry Pi** teaches you how to build sensor networks with *Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and XBee* radio modules, and even shows you how to turn your *Raspberry Pi* into a *MySQL* database server to store your sensor data!

- - -
First you’ll learn about the different types of sensors and sensor networks, including how to build a simple *XBee* network. Then you’ll walk through building an Arduino-based temperature sensor and data collector, followed by building a *Raspberry Pi*-based sensor node.

Next you’ll learn different ways to store sensor data, including writing to an SD card, sending data to the cloud, and setting up a *Raspberry Pi MySQL* server to host your data. You even learn how to connect to and interact with a *MySQL* database server directly from an *Arduino*! Finally you’ll learn how to put it all together by connecting your *Arduino* sensor node to your new *Raspberry Pi* database server.

If you want to see how well *Arduino* and *Raspberry Pi* can get along, especially to create a sensor network, then Beginning Sensor Networks with Arduino and *Raspberry Pi* is just the book you need.
What you’ll learn

   * How to build sensor nodes with both Arduino and Raspberry Pi!
   
   * What is XBee?
   
   * What methods you have for storing sensor data
   
   * How you can host your data on the Raspberry Pi
   
   * How to get started with the MySQL database connector for Arduino
   
   * How to build database enabled sensor networks

Who this book is for

Electronics enthusiasts, *Arduino and Raspberry Pi* fans, and anyone who wants hands-on experience seeing how these two amazing platforms, *Arduino and Raspberry Pi*, can work together with *MySQL*.
