# How I migrated from PHP to Vuepress 2 (Part II)

This is the second part of the series of articles about how has been the experience of migrating a blog made in _PHP + MySQL_, to a static one using _Vuepress 2_. Here we talk about the new design and the technology used, and some caveats I found during the migration.

## Vue

Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library focuses on the view layer only, and it is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. It's maintained by the community, and Vite is the only framework supported for Vue officialy. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated single-page applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.
