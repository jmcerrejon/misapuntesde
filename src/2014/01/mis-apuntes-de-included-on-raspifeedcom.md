# Mis Apuntes de included on raspifeed.com

![raspifeed.com](/images/2014/01/raspifeed.jpg)

I am proud to announce that last month personally contacted with me _Jan Karres_, developer and founder of [raspifeed.de](https://raspifeed.de), that belonged to a new [Planet Blogs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)>) including feeds collected in English with the latest articles of the most important blogs about _Raspberry Pi_.

Hence it has come to live [raspifeed.com](https://raspifeed.com), with blogs as well known as **Raspberry Web Server, Raspberry PI Adventures, RasPi.TV, Raspberry Pi@Adafruit o Raspberry PiPod** among others. Now it will be easier to follow all these blogs in one place.

I want to thank to _Jan_ for thinking about my blog to be part of this initiative.
