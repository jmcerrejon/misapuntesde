# PiCAST 2.0 out!

![picast](/images/2014/01/picast.jpg)

*Chromecast* takes time with us. It is a technology that like to us, but it has not been implemented everything would have liked to *Google*. 

*PiCAST* is an alternative to this device (or so intended), but it was difficult to configure and even received money from user. Its creator now shows version 2.0 to amend past mistakes.

Now we have the opportunity to download and run the installer with the following statement:

```bash
wget https://raw.github.com/lanceseidman/PiCAST/master/installer.sh
chmod +x ./installer.sh
./installer.sh
```

Presumably we can listen to music, open a web browser and watch videos. I have not tried and if anyone does, I'd like you to comment below.
