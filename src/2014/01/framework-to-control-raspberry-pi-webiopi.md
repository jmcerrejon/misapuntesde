# Framework to control Raspberry Pi: WebIOPi

![webiopi](/images/2014/01/webiopi.jpg)

Still sick, but today I woke up with a little encouragement to get some information that seems interesting to the blog. 

This time, I found a very interesting framework with which we will be able to have TOTAL control of our Pi. Do you want to see more?

**WebIOPi** is not updated in a while, but it's worth bearing in mind. Let's see what we can do with this framework: 

* Control, GPIO debug and use of sensors from a web browser or any application. 

* Written in Python and using Arduino syntax. 

* Support serie/SPI/I2C ports with a list of functions to control more than 30 devices. 

* Client HTML + Javascript to create a Web UI.

...and much more that you can find in the link.

Well, I'm going back to bed!...
