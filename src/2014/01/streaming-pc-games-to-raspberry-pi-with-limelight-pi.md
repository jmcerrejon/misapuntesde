# Streaming PC Games to Raspberry Pi with Limelight-Pi

![nVIDIA](/images/2014/01/nVidia_01.jpg)

The *PC* users with *nVIDIA* graphics accelerator are in luck. If you have a *GPU* of the *GTX 600/700* series, you can send your games and play them streaming through the *Raspberry Pi*...

*Limelight* is an open source *Java* implementation of *GameStream nVIDIA*, but built for *Linux/OSX/Windows.*

**Limelight Pi** is still in a very early stage, but will transmit your *Steam* games to your TV through the network with the Pi.

Maybe is not a *Steam Machine* killer, but comes close.

**Updated:** A user has tried and it works!. He recommended that we install to solve input and audio problems the library **libopus-dev**. Thanks *Felix Piechaczyk*!.
