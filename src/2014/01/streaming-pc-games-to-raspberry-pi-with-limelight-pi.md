# Streaming PC Games to Raspberry Pi with Limelight-Pi

![nVIDIA](/images/2014/01/nVidia_01.jpg)

The _PC_ users with _nVIDIA_ graphics accelerator are in luck. If you have a _GPU_ of the _GTX 600/700_ series, you can send your games and play them streaming through the _Raspberry Pi_...

_Limelight_ is an open source _Java_ implementation of _GameStream nVIDIA_, but built for _Linux/OSX/Windows._

**Limelight Pi** is still in a very early stage, but will transmit your _Steam_ games to your TV through the network with the Pi.

Maybe is not a _Steam Machine_ killer, but comes close.

**Updated:** A user has tried and it works!. He recommended that we install to solve input and audio problems the library **libopus-dev**. Thanks _Felix Piechaczyk_!.
