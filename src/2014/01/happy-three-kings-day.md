# Happy Three Kings day!

![reyes_magos](/images/2014/01/reyesmagos.jpg)

There are three kings who left Orient for the birth of the new *King of the Jews*

A tradition that brings every *January, 6* gifts for all children and not so young.

* **Melchior** bring a new [rpix86](http://rpix86.patrickaalto.com/rpix86.zip) version and a blog to install [some games](http://ledgerlabs.us/raspberrypi/).
