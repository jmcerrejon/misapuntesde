![lichee](/images/2014/01/lychee.jpg)

Would you like to have all the photos available in a web gallery with a nice environment to show everyone your creations?. No?... Anyway I was going to teach you...

[Lichee](http://lychee.electerious.com) is a gallery to install on a web server very easy to use, and in seconds you have it ready. With it you will be able to upload your pictures, manage like a native application and is quite attractive. 

I encourage you to install it. The guys from [pihomeserver.fr](http://www.pihomeserver.fr) will teach you. You have a demo [here](http://electerious.com/lychee_demo/).
