# SD Images to play Game Boy Color, Atari or MSX in a few seconds on Raspberry Pi

![OctopusPi](/images/2014/12/octopu10.png)

Occasionally Internet surprises us unintentionally. A French user with the nick _Dr Floyd_ has created a SD customized for a single emulator images. You wont have to wait long, **usually begin in seconds**...

They are images that can download through _Dropbox_. Once decompressed takes about _4GB_.

It's _Arch Linux_ prepared specifically for a Pi based console called _OctopusPi_ which was promoted by _Kickstarter_. Comes with _Kernel 3.10.38-1_. we can access through _SSH_ (_root@root_) but games can be copied from the _/boot/games_ directory which has _FAT32_ (_1.5GB free_).

Work with the _Raspberry Pi Model A and B_ (problems with detecting joystick with model _B+_).

Emulators available are:

-   Game Boy Color

-   Atari 400/800/800XL/1200XL

-   MSX/MSX2

Enjoy!
