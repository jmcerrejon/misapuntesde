# SD Images to play Game Boy Color, Atari or MSX in a few seconds on Raspberry Pi

![OctopusPi](/images/2014/12/octopu10.png)

Occasionally Internet surprises us unintentionally. A French user with the nick *Dr Floyd* has created a SD customized for a single emulator images. You wont have to wait long, **usually begin in seconds**...

They are images that can download through *Dropbox*. Once decompressed takes about *4GB*.

It's *Arch Linux* prepared specifically for a Pi based console called *OctopusPi* which was promoted by *Kickstarter*. Comes with *Kernel 3.10.38-1*. we can access through *SSH* (*root@root*) but games can be copied from the */boot/games* directory which has *FAT32* (*1.5GB free*).

Work with the *Raspberry Pi Model A and B* (problems with detecting joystick with model *B+*).

Emulators available are:

* Game Boy Color

* Atari 400/800/800XL/1200XL

* MSX/MSX2

Enjoy!
