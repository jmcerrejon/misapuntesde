# Berryboot on Banana Pi

![Berryboot](/images/berryboot.jpg)

_Berryboot_ is a small distribution to install operating systems designed primarily for _Raspberry Pi _. It has been ported to _Banana Pi_ to make it easier to install multiple distros and not die trying...

The first thing to do is to _"burn"_ the image from [this link](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B38hUt6ypQXDQlM3eDdxVV9zcTA/edit). Then you can simply unzip and "burn" a _SD_ as you would do with any other distro.

### [ Installing your own images ]

Berryboot gives you the ability to insert a flash drive with an _.img_ file and install an operating system that is not in their official repositories. This will generate a new entry in the menu and you can access through it. This is done by clicking on **Install from USB stick**. If you want a specific memory _GPU/CPU_ shared setting, you must specify it changing the extension _.img_ with _.img128, .img192, .img224 or .img240_

### [ Conclusion ]

_Berryboot_ provides a simple way to install distributions uncomplicated and from a very friendly interface. From _Gentoo_ to _Bananian_ through _ArchLinux, Lubuntu or Raspbian_. Recommended especially the initiates who want to start testing operating systems without stopping until you find one with which you are most comfortable.
