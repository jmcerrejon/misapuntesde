# Demo XBMC-Gamebox: Airplay mirroring for Raspberry Pi (Youtube)

![XBMC Gamebox](/images/2014/12/gamebox-logo.png)

Last Friday I wrote about a new competitor for *rPLAY*. Well, I have tested and I want to show you in the video below a demo...

- - -
First say that it's an image with *1.3 GB* based on *Raspbmc. I've tested with a *Raspberry Pi Model B*.

With the first boot, the image resize the partition to take up all the space on your *SD card*.

Once the system has rebooted, you will see *XBMC version 13.2 (Oct, 2014)*. Now you must to choose the language, which has not worked for me but it is not important.

In the *Programs* section we find *Raspbmc settings and www.xindawn.com*... the last doesn't works.

We will activate *Airplay mirroring* because that's what we want.

The system moves fluid as you can see in the video. I tried several games and some are not going at all well, taking cuts that make it difficult to play.

The video streaming has lag from  *iPhone 6 and iPad Mini Retina*, perhaps due to the buffer is too small. If you play from the Video reel, no problems.

Doesn't works when you want to power off the Raspberry Pi from the power menu, so you have to unplug it even without being the *Raspberry* off.

The conclusion I reach is that if you want to use *Airplay mirroring* technology, this solution just works if you do not want to spend the money on an *AppleTV*. About *Raspbmc*, is not as stable as we would like but it's OK.

What if I want to run Gamebox from *Raspbian* to take advantages from *Airplay Mirroring* protocol?. You can. Follow the instructions in the next post in the forum.
