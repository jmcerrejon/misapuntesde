# Maynard, Wayland-based desktop for Raspberry Pi

Be honest, *LXDE* is a lightweight desktop but not have hardware acceleration makes opening any application an odyssey and take longer than we wish. Nearly a year ago we know the development of [Wayland](/post.php?id=167) but everything is in a *Alpha* state and we don't  know when come to us.

*Maynard* will be a *X* replacement with hardware acceleration and moves quite well as you can see in the video. It doesn't support applications that are not developed for it yet, but you can try it if you dare running the following commands:

```bash
wget http://raspberrypi.collabora.co.uk/setup-maynard.sh
bash ./setup-maynard.sh
```
