# Rpi Simple Monitor (Android App)

![rpi simple monitor](/images/2014/04/rpisimplemonitor.jpg)

From the _Twitter_ account [@raspipc](https://twitter.com/raspipc) I know a new application to monitor the state of our _Raspberry Pi_ through _Android_. Their name: **RPI-Simple Monitor**...

The application displays information about _CPU, RAM_ or temperature through an elegant interface.

You need to install a server program on the _Pi_.

I encourage everyone to try and I'm pretty sure the developer would appreciate feedback through their _Twitter_ [@laux_es](https://twitter.com/laux_es) or in the _Google Play_.
