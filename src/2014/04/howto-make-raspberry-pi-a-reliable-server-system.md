# Howto make Raspberry Pi a reliable server system!

![SD](/images/sd%20pile.png)

This week I am a little distracted with personal business, but remember that the **contest ending tomorrow** and you can win a book about **Raspberry Pi**. You have the details [here](/post.php?id=381).

Today I bring you a link for those who plan to just set up a server on your Raspberry Pi, from the point of view of the SD card and file system optimization.

*Guido Stepken* is a professional from *Berlin* and he has been reviewing the importance of a good storage system. In this case the *SD* card, although we use for almost everything, has a very low access times and is best to get a good quality *SD* card and use the best file system like this one by *Samsung* called [F2FS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS). 

Do not miss this interesting article if you want to make the most of your card.
