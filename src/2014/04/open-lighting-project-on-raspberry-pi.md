# Open Lighting Project on Raspberry Pi

![OLA](/images/2014/04/OLA.jpg)

One of the things that give more attention on the Pi is the versatility to suit any hardware project: Control servo motors, lights, automation systems, etc..

Open Lighting Project tries to establish a standardization protocols to control lighting systems via software and open source hardware. 

The next awesome video shows what can be achieved with this system...

The [Open Lighting Architecture](http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA) (a.k.a. OLA), It is a framework that supports all types of devices and architectures. This project participated in the [Google Summer of Code 2012/13](http://www.openlighting.org/openlightingproject/gsoc/). Another interesting aspect is that you have an *API* for languages like *C++* or *Python*.

In short, buy a hardware that suits your project and the software that we present in the following tutorial from *openlighting.org* and you can control any lighting system no matter how powerful is. 

It's an interesting system mounted on *Open Hardware* certainly be cheaper of your projects and was previously only available to enterprises.
