# Survive to the Back Week with a Raspberry Pi: IRC clients

![pi hacker](/images/pi_hack.jpg)

Since last **April 28** is celebrating an event called _The Black Week_ (La Semana Negra in spanish). Objective: Survive one week only with the _Shell_ with no desktop environment. Do you accept the challenge?.

I found it interesting proposal and I'm actually excited, since many people are moving into the _Linux_ world thanks to the Pi. You don't be afraid black background with letters any more!.

You should avoid write _startx_ voluntarily, but keep calm, because you are not alone. I'll show you some applications to notice that you do not need a mouse to write an email, browse the internet or post to _Twitter_.

Today we start to get into the _IRC_ and meet people like you who are participating in this initiative. So you can share and learn about new applications that will serve you throughout this week.

My proposal for a good _IRC_ client will be _weechat_.

To install: **sudo apt-get install weechat**

Once we execute it with _weechat_, we will connect to the freenode network typing **/connect holmes.freenode.net**. Now we can enter various chat rooms, but which we are interested to get into #semananegra on spanish irc channel, so type: **/join #semananegra**

Another usefull _IRC_ commands are:

-   Change nick name: **/nick new_nick**

-   Send a private message: **/msg nick message**

-   Show users in the channel: **/names**

-   Leave chat room: **/part room_name custom_exit_message**

-   Exit from the app: **/quit**

Another keys:

-   TAB: Autocomplete nicks or texts.

-   Alt+Cursor left/right: You move through the different buffers you have open (To learn more about the buffers, read the link I put at the end of the article).

With this you can manage a little longer, but there are still many things to learn, but that depends on you ;)

If you don't like weechat, you can install another one like **irssi** or you can use a _XMPP_ client called [profanity](https://www.profanity.im/index.html).

Just for today. You can comment your impressions if you wish.

See you tomorrow!
