# SliTaz: New distro for the Raspberry Pi

![SliTaz](/images/2014/04/slitaz.jpg)

SliTaz is distributed for Raspberry Pi as a series of files with a size **less than 100 MB uncompressed**, providing a fast, robust and elegant system who work entirely in memory.

Another distribution to _ARM_ devices.

SliTaz run in RAM when booted with an compressed root file system called an initramfs/initrd. The amazing is that the whole system will be loaded in just **20MB of available RAM**.

The list with [supported packages](https://arm.slitaz.org/tools.cgi?pkgs) is still low, but their functionality to perform server potential is so great. It can even be generated with a proprietary tool and get a fresh raspberry flavor :P

You will need to uncompress the base package and create in your _SD_ three partitions: _boot, swap and root_ . Then run the installer and that's all.

I have not made ​​it to work by a permissions problem, but I hope do it soon and offer to you a deeper analysis.
