# News this week on the Pi World

![Banana Pi](/images/2014/04/bananapi.jpg)

This week we have as usual new and good projects to keep an eye. Want to know more?

* **Mosquitto message system:** I had read about this project, but not sure what it was. It is a system to transport messages with the *MQTT protocol*. Devices can "talk" with a variety architecture. Imagine a sensor sending messages to a mobile or an Arduino. | [jpmens.net](http://jpmens.net/2013/09/01/installing-mosquitto-on-a-raspberry-pi/)

* **Banana Pi, Raspberry Pi clone with steroids:** Pow! Right in the kisser. This is a new competitor you have to look twice to avoid confusion with the Pi. Bring a *1GHz Allwinner A20 dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 con 1 GB de RAM* for about $55. Details in [geeky-gadgets.com](http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/banana-pi-raspberry-pi-clone-offers-more-memory-and-faster-processor-for-57-21-04-2014/). You can buy it on their website [bananapi.org](http://www.bananapi.org) or [aliexpress.com](http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=banana+pi&catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20140420072100) although careful you do not go to brew a Raspberry Pi.

* **piCore 5.3alpha2:** This distro advancing with leaps and bounds and brings *kernel 3.14.1, Raspberry Pi firmware (14 April, 2014), BusyBox patches applied, improved tce-load*. | [tinycorelinux.net](http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php/topic,16951.0.html)

* **Raspberry Pi on tutplus:** I wanted to finish recommending the website [computers.tutsplus.com](http://computers.tutsplus.com/categories/electronics) with good tutorials about *Raspberry Pi*. 

Nothing more people. Until next time!
