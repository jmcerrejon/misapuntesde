# Contest Results Win a book about Raspberry Pi

![cookbook](/images/2014/01/rpi_cookbook.jpg)

Today is the [World Book Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Book_Day) and I wanted to resolve the contest [I announced](/post.php?id=381) a few weeks ago.

The winner is [@sdeancos](https://twitter.com/sdeancos) and the chosen book [Raspberry Pi Cookbook](/post.php?id=350). I've already been in contact with him and the book will arrive this Friday via [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Cookbook-Simon-Monk-ebook/dp/B00H8B64FE/).

Congratulation!
