# Sonic Pi v2.0

![Sonic Pi](/images/2014/06/sonic_pi.png)

Curious that even though looking at my blog, I can't find no post has mentioned *Sonic Pi*, and soon we will see the version 2.0 of this free program that allows development to teach programming through music...

- - -
With *Sonic Pi* you'll be able to teach some programming concept through a simple programming environment, ideal for starting from the earliest age.

An example:

```bash
# flight of the bumblebee RasPi.TV style (or lack thereof)
# http://raspi.tv/?p=5216

# first some rythms
speed = 0.45  #set overall speed
breve = 8 * speed
semibreve = 4 * speed
minim = 2 * speed
crotchet = 1 * speed
quaver = 0.5 * speed
semi = 0.25 * speed
demi = 0.125 * speed
hemi = 0.0625 * speed
```

Still do not know what new features will have this new version, but in the article on [The Mag Pi](http://www.themagpi.com/issue/issue-23/)  last month you can read a full article.
