# Raspbian Net Install+PiKISS = Perfect OS combination

![minibian](/images/minibian.jpg)

This is not really a post, it's more a recommendation.

Yesterday I just got to try again [Raspbian NetInstall UA](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst), which is a *Raspbian* minimal distribution with minimal packages without much...

- - -
I tried on it **PiKISS** and to my surprise almost all the scripts works except some of it with missing packages.

I have found with **the most optimized Raspbian OS existing**. That's why I added a new script to the family to set some settings in this cropped version of *Raspbian*. You can find it in the *Config* section of *PiKISS*.

The result has been a considerable improvement in emulators. For example *MAME4ALL* runs at optimum speed without sound problems I always had in *Raspbian* with some roms (*TMNT2*).

I advise change. Your impressions in the comments.
