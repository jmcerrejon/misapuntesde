# The World Cup with Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu

![Brasil 2014](/images/2014/06/brasil2k14.png)

**SCRIPT UPDATED:** 18/Jun/2014 7:37 GMT +1

**NOTE:** Now you can enjoy more channels with the new script that I have prepared. Click on this new post: [PiKISS: Two new scripts join to the family](/post.php?id=418)

I do not like football, but with the excuse to watch the match we meet friends for lunch/drunk.

Want to see it too? Take your *Raspberry Pi* or a computer with *Ubuntu* because I have prepared a script to enjoy the show...

**NOTE:** Sorry, only spanish audio, but if you want it in english, tell me in the comments...

Just boot your *Ubuntu or Raspbian* and execute the following:

```bash
curl /gol.sh |bash
```


For *Ubuntu* you need to install **mplayer** and with *Raspbian* you will need **omxplayer** (HDMI output). Both should have them already installed in their respective operating systems.

If the signal goes, I will try to update the file.
