# Play Return to Castle Wolfenstein with PiKISS

I have been visiting many links on our beloved Pi as you can see in the [Google Docs My Notes](http://goo.gl/Iwhbq), but none has particularly struck me to make a post. However...

Reviewing the comments leave me about  **PiKISS** [here](/post.php?id=411) and [here](/post.php?id=409), take note of any of them to include new scripts while increasing the family with a couple more. 

Now you can enjoy *Return to Castle Wolfenstein demo version* and the *Amiga* emulator *UAE4Armiga4Pi* that looks good.
