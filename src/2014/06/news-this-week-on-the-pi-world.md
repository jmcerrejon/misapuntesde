# News this week on the Pi World

![Raspbery Pi](/images/RPi_compute_module.png)

This week has been quite active on the blog and on Friday I stay on top, so the section is full of news today. The most anticipated: the sale of the _Raspberry Pi modular version_ for large and small projects. But that's not all...

I wanted to remember that this week [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS) has received some updates and added some new scripts: _check_lastmod_img, minidlna, Epiphany Web Browser, crispy-doom, Quake 2, MAME4ALL, Gameboy Advance & PCEngine._

-   **PiFox, tribute to Star Fox:** Earlier this week we saw proof of concept created by the _Imperial College London_. An independent game with 5800 lines of code with a [Bare Metal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16810/bare-metal-environment) system for ARM devices that you can visit on GitHub. As a curiosity, they've used a [Raspberry Pi emulator](https://github.com/ICTeam28/PiEmu) called _PiEmu_ with the source code available too. If you are left wanting more, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTqKRdcKZ9k) you can find a video of a _Tetris multiplayer_ programed with about 4000 code lines in pure assembly code | [github.com > PiFox](https://github.com/ICTeam28/PiFox)

-   **Build Space Invaders with Python:** In only 300 lines you can create this arcade classic if you like. It is a good start for those who want to learn programming or how to develop a video game | [linuxuser.co.uk > Create Space Invaders on Raspberry Pi (part one) ](https://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/create-space-invaders-on-raspberry-pi-part-one) [(part two)](https://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/create-space-invaders-on-raspberry-pi-part-two)
