# Tor or how to hide your tracks on the Internet

![Tor Pi](/images/2014/06/torPI.png)

By now we all know that each search direction we visit or comment that we make on the internet, like it or not, will be registered with our **IP**.

[Tor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor) becomes a project to not reveal our identity (*IP*) passing through other PCs and so leave our hidden secret to all kinds of requests corporations, governmental or not.

I admit that sometimes I have done internet searches undesirable and I'm ashamed. But surely you  do this practice too. **YES**, I searched *Youtube* video of *Rebecca Black* or use *Google* to know how to shave without cutting.

But the **NSA** will not know this information because a user has prepared this script  to convert [Moebius Linux](http://moebiuslinux.sourceforge.net/) distribution in a whole *onion router*. It would be interesting to do the same for *Raspbian*, because I'm not a fan of the distribution that has used its author. It remains to incorporate into **PiKISS**.
