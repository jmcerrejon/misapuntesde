# Syncthing: Open source P2P file sync

![Syncthing](/images/2014/06/Syncthing.jpg)

We all know [bittorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/es/sync) and [I talked about](/post.php?id=247) this method to have the files on hand. 

*Syncthing* becomes the solution to these open source systems such as centralized storage like *Dropbox*...

With *Syncthing* you have a way to store your data and have it available whenever you want and wherever you wan, using the *P2P* protocol. 

Some of its features are:

* synchronize as many folders as you need with different people

* responsive web GUI;

* cross-platform: Syncthing works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, FreeBSD and Solaris. There's also an unofficial Android port;

* Syncthing doesn't require advanced configuration and it should work out of the box, both over LAN and over the Internet;

* secure & private: the data is only stored on your computers, without using a central server;
all communication is secured using TLS;

* every node is identified by a strong cryptographic certificate and only nodes you have explicitly allowed can connect to your cluster;

* open source app, open protocol.
