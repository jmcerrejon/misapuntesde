# Raspberry Pi A+

![RPiA+](/images/RPiap.png)
Eben Upton spoke about it a few months ago and it's already the new revision of the *Model A*, with changes almost all expected...

Obviously this is a *B+ model* cut in benefits to give your projects a system less power consumption. Here are its features, although you imagine:

* 700MHz Broadcom BCM2835 CPU

* 256MB RAM

* 40pin extended GPIO

* Better sound

* 1 x USB 2 ports

* 4 pole Stereo output and Composite video port

* Full size HDMI

* CSI camera port

* DSI display port (Raspberry Pi touch screen display)

* 4 mounting holes

* Micro SD port

* Micro USB power connector

* The board has a smaller footprint but is fully HAT compatible

* Size: 56mm x 65 mm

* Weight: 23 gr.

* No Ethernet port

In my humble opinion, they are still fail putting only *256MB RAM*. They should have taken advantage and launch the plate with *512MB*, I'm sure sales would reach the top. What do you think about it?
