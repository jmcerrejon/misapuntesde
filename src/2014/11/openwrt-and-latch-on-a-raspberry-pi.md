If you don't know what I'm talking about and want to know more, read on...

[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) is basically an operating system specifically designed to provide network functionality to a computer or router that can act as a *firewall, AP WiFi,sniffer*, etc. Yes, you can install it on a *TP-Link o Asus router* or choose embedded devices such our lovely *Raspberry Pi*. 


[Latch](https://latch.elevenpaths.com/www/service.html) is an online service to add a layer of security to any project: bank accounts, servers *Web/ftp  servers, developments*,... All controlled by a panel to protect that what we protect: **Our privacy**. Recommended this read.
