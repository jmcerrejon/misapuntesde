# rPlay at the end of November for the Banana Pi

![rplay](/images/airplay.jpg)

If I were you I would buying a *Banana Pi*. 

Today browsing the forums on *bananapi.com* I see that the community is moving quite. Although lack of good support in the graphics hardware acceleration, we can see interesting projects soon.

For now, we will have a *rPLAY* version for *Banana Pi* (paid) with support for: **AirPlay, AirPlay mirroring, and Miracast Chromecast**. Video of his performance below...

The price of this software is not yet confirmed but will be around **$5-10**. Pretty good if they promise what we can see. The big problem of *Raspberry Pi* is their *CPU* and can't run *Google Chrome* decently, so I don't think it will continue its development beyond the beta we have.

The software will run on any version of *Android 4.3+*. 

It will be available on the [bananapi.com](http://bananapi.com) website and probably I'll get one license.
