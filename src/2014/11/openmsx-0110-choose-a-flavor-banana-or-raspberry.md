# OpenMSX 0.11.0. Choose a flavor: Banana or Raspberry.

![MSX](/images/msx.png)

This weekend I have been exchanging emails with the staff of _openMSX emulator_ and have compiled the latest version of which I consider the **best MSX emulator** at the moment. Do you want to run on the **Raspberry Pi at 50 fps**?, Want to try the first port of this emulator for **Banana Pi**?. Enters without knocking!...

If you want to see the changelog go to this announcement on [msx.org](https://www.msx.org/news/en/openmsx-0110-released).

I know you're dying to try it, so if you have a _Raspberry Pi_, I updated the [post](/post.php?id=382) where you can get it.

For _Banana Pi_ users, I used _Bananian_ as distro to compile and the link with instructions to make it work are the same as in the post I mentioned for _Raspberry Pi_ users. You can find the download link at the end of this post. Remember to install the dependencies: _apt-get install libglew1.7 libtheora0 libao4_.

The emulator is surprisingly well on both platforms, although I notice that on _BPi_ goes better.

I want to thank the members of _openMSX Team_ and specially to _Patrick van Arkel_ and _Manual Bilderbeek_ for the help received in the _IRC channel (freenode) #openmsx_. Some of them already have a _Raspberry Pi_, so you will enjoy a compiled version by themselves of this great emulator soon.
