# Top Operating Systems with img updated recently (Nov, 2014)

![OS](/images/sd%20pile.png)

It seems like yesterday and it's been six months since [this](/post.php?id=400) compilation of operating systems. I think it's time to review the distros that have updated their images or have been forgotten...

-   SliTaz (Mar)

-   MinePeon (Mar)

-   Moebius (Jun 2013)

### [ Conclusion ]

In the past has gone distros like _Inferno_ that promised to be a very profitable experiment. Many are also committed _pipaOS_, but not updated since July and I think the author does not have a lot of courage to release it to the top (I've tried to contact with him and not responding). Leaves the list _SqueezePlug_ that we can replace it with _piCorePlayer_. _SliTaz_ still generate packages. I wanted to add _Moebius_ because he enjoyed some popularity, but its author is tired of _Debian_ distros, but promises a revolutionary new version. We look.

_FreeBSD_ continues to update their OS. _Media Centers_ also have regular monthly updates. I have joined the list updated with _Diet PI_ that I want to keep an eye. We has _Sonic-Pi, OpenSUSE and Slackware_ among others. _Firefox OS_ added but still not more than a proof of concept.

Overall distros for _Raspberry Pi_ are healthy and most stay alive... Live long and prosper!.
