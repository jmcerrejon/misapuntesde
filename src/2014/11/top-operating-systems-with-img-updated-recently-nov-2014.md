# Top Operating Systems with img updated recently (Nov, 2014)

![OS](/images/sd%20pile.png)

It seems like yesterday and it's been six months since [this](/post.php?id=400) compilation of operating systems. I think it's time to review the distros that have updated their images or have been forgotten...

Distros which have not been updated in the past six months:

* PiCore (May)

* SqueezePlug (May)

* SliTaz (Mar)

* MinePeon (Mar)

* Moebius (Jun 2013)

### [ Conclusion ]

In the past has gone distros like *Inferno* that promised to be a very profitable experiment. Many are also committed *pipaOS*, but not updated since July and I think the author does not have a lot of courage to release it to the top (I've tried to contact with him and not responding). Leaves the list *SqueezePlug* that we can replace it with *piCorePlayer*. *SliTaz* still generate packages. I wanted to add *Moebius* because he enjoyed some popularity, but its author is tired of *Debian* distros, but promises a revolutionary new version. We look.

*FreeBSD* continues to update their OS. *Media Centers* also have regular monthly updates. I have joined the list updated with *Diet PI* that I want to keep an eye. We has *Sonic-Pi, OpenSUSE and Slackware* among others. *Firefox OS* added but still not more than a proof of concept.

Overall distros for *Raspberry Pi* are healthy and most stay alive... Live long and prosper!.
