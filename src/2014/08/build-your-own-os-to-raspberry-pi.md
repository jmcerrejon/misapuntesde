Today it is easy to create one distro for your desktop or for embedded systems. In the case of _Linux_ we have plenty of tools to create an operating system according to our needs andto _Raspberry Pi_ we can build one using [delog.wordpress.com](https://delog.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/custom-embedded-linux-system-for-raspberry-pi-with-buildroot-2/)... Don't you believe it?
