# DietPi: Light distro for the summer

![minibian](/images/minibian.jpg)

I think *Dan Knight* has struggled to their distro lose weight more than me lose 11 kg. before summer.

*DietPi* is essentially a **Debian image optimized for the Pi**. It comes in two versions: *Server or torrent + download FTP*...

- - -
All the tweaks and initial setup is done for you to ensure your Pi runs at its best.

DietPi - Core Stats:


* Optimized Debian Image for the Pi. Raspberry Pi, on a diet!

* Small <271MB~ Filesystem footprint

* 9 processes

* <10MB~ of memory usage on boot

* Pi Safe Clock = 900mhz CPU // 250mhz GPU // 400mhz RAM // 2 Overvolt

* 16/256mb 16/512mb GPU memory splits for Server images

* All Log files (except fsck) goto /dev/null. Save that SD card!

* Ready to mount ext4 USB external drive.

Do not forget to donate to the cause if you find it interesting the project on the following website.
