**HAT** (*Hardware Attached on Top*) is a new module for the *Raspberry Pi B +* who add functionality to it and is mounted on top like a *Arduino Shield*.

*Adafruit* was developed during the last week a prototype every day and the result will be able to check on your [web](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/?s=%23hataday).
