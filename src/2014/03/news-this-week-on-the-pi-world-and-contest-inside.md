* **Armiga: Amiga with a heart of Raspberry Pi:** A new *Crowdfunding* campaign from *Spanish* guys to take our money. It's a *Rasberry Pi + expansion board + floppy* to read *Amiga* disk among others. More info on [indiegogo.com](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/armiga-project) 

* **7 games that can help you become a better programmer:** Not directly related, but I found an post that collect what is called today the [Gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) to learn a programming languaje with games. Detail in the next translated link from [genbetadev.com](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genbetadev.com%2Ftrabajar-como-desarrollador%2Faprende-jugando-siete-juegos-que-te-pueden-ayudar-a-ser-mejor-programador)
