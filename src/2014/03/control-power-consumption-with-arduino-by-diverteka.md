# Control power consumption with Arduino by Diverteka

![money](/images/money_saver.jpg)

Winds of change are coming in my professional life and this week I've been a little busy to see where my work life goes now, hence it has not updated in a while. Now I'm a real *Freelance*, so now on the blog you could see post from other interest than the *Pi*. That's why today I bring you a great course about Arduino devices from blogger *Txus* (Diverteka)

Regarding my future , I have a project in hand that will give me cash this year, so I'll be quiet on that aspect. Several of my blog readers have sent me emails asking what happened these days. I appreciate your mails as if you were family, really.

From here I **call you** If you have a project and you need a developer. No matter whether in *Spain* or elsewhere in the *World*. If you need references please send me an e-mail. Thanks :)

Now I leave you with this fantastic course by *Diverteka* where we can learn to control our spending power devices from a theoretical and practical base.
