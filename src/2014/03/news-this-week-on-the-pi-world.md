# News this week on the Pi World

![cam](/images/cam.jpg)

March 21 and the weekend is approaching. I've barely had time to play with my dear _Pi_ due to many changes in my professional life. But here's the weekly summary of what matters most to the Pi community...

---

-   **New Camera-Pi modes released:** Optimized the software for supporting higher resolutions and better usability, and fix bugs in preview mode. You can expand the news on [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/6475)

-   **Private Git server on your RPi:** I have a super-secret private _Git server_ for my use and enjoyment that I do not share with anyone. It was hard to put it online, but now you can also have it through these simple steps that explain us [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/GitPi-A-Private-Git-Server-on-Raspberry-Pi/?ALLSTEPS)

-   **Chest opening with facial recognition:** _Tony DiCola_ has prepared a chest with a _Raspberry Pi_ + camera that open just showing your face to the RasPi-Cam. It seems complex but it is easier to make than we think. Seen on [makezine.com](https://makezine.com/projects/pi-face-treasure-box/)

Happy weekend!
