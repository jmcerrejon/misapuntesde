# PiMAME 0.8 Beta 1 SD card image available!

![pimame](/images/mame.jpg)

In early February I [write](/post.php?id=360) about the script about PiMAME and we had available a preview of this distribution Raspbian based, to play emulators without any effort. Today we have the image available to make things work _out of the box_...

Remember that _PiMAME_ is a _Raspbian_ distribution with menu at startup so that we can enjoy with _PSX, MAME or Neo Geo_ emulators, among others.

I have a couple of post waiting for this release and now that I have I can't seen the news anywhere. As said, unless it have some bugs to correct, everything works fine.

I will update this post when I test it. While here it is.
