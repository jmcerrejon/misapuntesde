# PiMAME 0.8 Preview Release

![piMAME](/images/PiMAME.jpg)

This post could have been good on a Friday, but I found today Monday... _Shea_ has released a _Preview_ that you can easily install on your _Raspbian_.

---

Remember that _PiMAME_ will allow you to install a bunch of emulators on an easy way through a SD image or a script.

Emulators list:

-   Gearboy 1.4

-   Advancemame 1.2 y mame4all

-   Advancemess 0.102.0.1

-   DGEN sdl 1.32

-   gngeo 0.8 y pifba ([BIOS](https://app.box.com/s/u5whbrrp3gupopi3kh6r))

-   gpsp 0.91

-   pcsx_rearmed r19

-   pisnes 1.39

For the script installation, simply type the following and enjoy in your _Raspbian_ distribution

```bash
wget -O - https://pimame.org/installer.sh | bash
```

_Mr. Silverman_ need to know how this new version behaves, so if you test, contact with him to tell it's amazing.
