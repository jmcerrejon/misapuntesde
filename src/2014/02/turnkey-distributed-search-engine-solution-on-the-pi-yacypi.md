# Turnkey Distributed Search Engine Solution on the Pi: YaCyPi

![dontbeevil](/images/2014/02/dontbeevil.jpg)

*Google* was our favorite search engine when *Yahoo* or *AltaVista* taught to us what was the advertising. Now *Google* and his *"Don't be Evil"* slogan, sell our information and unfortunatelly we have a strong dependence to use it today. 

What about get your own search engine with your *Pi*? I'll teach you a new *Kickstarter* project with this idea in mind.

*"YaCyPi is a turnkey solution for the Raspberry Pi with the goal of turning a common ordinary Raspberry Pi (Model B) into your very own search engine. Using the software YaCy, you no longer need to be bound by Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc for your internet queries."*

Like I said, It's a new *Kickstarter* project who has reached this goal in a short space of time.

It's based in a *Puppy Linux O*S. It's a decentralized search engine technology based on a *peer-to-peer* index-sharing network, under *GPL* license.
 You can run this *OS* not only in the *Pi: Odroid3* and *BeagleBone Black* are included.
