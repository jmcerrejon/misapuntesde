It works fooling game consoles, in other words making them believe they are in the same network the other console is, to achieve this it requires you to connect your console to the same network router or switch where your PC is connected to internet, then let the software web interface detect your console. 

To install, you need to download, uncompress & run the next package:

```bash
wget http://canadian-gaming.ca/xlinkkai/builds/release/kaiEngine-7.4.28-RC1-linux-arm-headless-raspberry-pi.tar.gz
tar xzvf kaiEngine-7.4.28-RC1-linux-arm-headless-raspberry-pi.tar.gz
cd kaiEngine-7.4.28-raspberry-pi
./kaiengine
```
