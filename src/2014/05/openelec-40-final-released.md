![XBMC Gotham](/images/2014/05/xbmc_gotham.jpg)

After a few betas (seven in total) from early on March 6 of this year, we have with us the latest version of considered the best Media Center for Raspberry Pi. I review everything that the team have been introduced in this couple of months...

I have supported this distribution always compared to others with the same purpouse. After the imminent appearance of *XBMC 13.0 "Gotham"*, could not miss the final version to enjoy our multimedia center without complications. The list of changes we have gradually seeing:

* buildsystem core updated: *gcc-4.9.0, eglibc-2.19, binutils-2.23.2 and llvm-3.4.*
* *Linux Kernel 3.14*
* *systemd* replaces *init system* like the common desktop linux distribution.
* *Bluetooth*, *wlan* & *Samba* better suport.
* *TTS via espeak*.
* *bcm2835-bootloader & bcm2835-driver* updated.
* *3D* movies support.
* Better streaming via *UPnP*.
* *ALSA* support enabled by default.
* Use *128MB GPU* even on *Raspberry Pi model A* with *256MB*.
* Auto resizing *SD* card.
