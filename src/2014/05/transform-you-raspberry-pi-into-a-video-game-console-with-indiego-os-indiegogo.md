# Transform you Raspberry Pi into a video game console with INDIEGO-OS (Indiegogo)

![INDIEGO-OS](/images/2014/05/indieos_appstore.jpg)

Another *crowdfunding* project that we can see and based on the premise of using **AEROS** operating system [already talked]( /post.php?id=202) as platform launching an *SteamOS* alternative like store. Let's see what offers to us...

Always is good for the community to support interesting projects to use with the Pi. Today I find this campaign to create a friendly environment with the *AROS core* and can be used on *PC, Mac, RPI, ODROID* or others. The *UI* is based on the *Amiga MediaCenter* and you can run games from *Amiga* , Windows (via *Wine* even *ARM*), *Linux* or *AROS* all via emulation. According you can read, it has the compatibility of *Linux*, because it is based on *Debian*, with the speed of *AROS*.

For the *"free for all" AEROS* release, which is something that concerns us all, they need 3,000 euros.

It is said that you will also have access through this system to *Steam, Desura and other stores*. For the *Raspberry Pi*, is planned to be also a gateway to *Streaming from PC* (with *Limelight*) and also serve as a platform of entertainment to watch multimedia files (videos, photos, music). Other things to pay attention is that run **Windows 8 ARM** apps with *wine*, though not perfect.

I leave you with the video of the campaign.
