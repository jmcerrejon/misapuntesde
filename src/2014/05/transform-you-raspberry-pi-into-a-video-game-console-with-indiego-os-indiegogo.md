# Transform you Raspberry Pi into a video game console with INDIEGO-OS (Indiegogo)

![INDIEGO-OS](/images/2014/05/indieos_appstore.jpg)

Another _crowdfunding_ project that we can see and based on the premise of using **AEROS** operating system [already talked](/post.php?id=202) as platform launching an _SteamOS_ alternative like store. Let's see what offers to us...

Always is good for the community to support interesting projects to use with the Pi. Today I find this campaign to create a friendly environment with the _AROS core_ and can be used on _PC, Mac, RPI, ODROID_ or others. The _UI_ is based on the _Amiga MediaCenter_ and you can run games from _Amiga_ , Windows (via _Wine_ even _ARM_), _Linux_ or _AROS_ all via emulation. According you can read, it has the compatibility of _Linux_, because it is based on _Debian_, with the speed of _AROS_.

For the _"free for all" AEROS_ release, which is something that concerns us all, they need 3,000 euros.

It is said that you will also have access through this system to _Steam, Desura and other stores_. For the _Raspberry Pi_, is planned to be also a gateway to _Streaming from PC_ (with _Limelight_) and also serve as a platform of entertainment to watch multimedia files (videos, photos, music). Other things to pay attention is that run **Windows 8 ARM** apps with _wine_, though not perfect.

I leave you with the video of the campaign.
