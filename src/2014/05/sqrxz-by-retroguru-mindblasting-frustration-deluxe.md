# Sqrxz by Retroguru - Mindblasting frustration deluxe! 

![sqrxz4](/images/2014/05/sqrxz4_01.png)

These kind of games remind me the famous [Apogee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee_Software) games that many hours have given me joy. Although with high difficulty, the *SQRXZ* saga have a version for all platforms... including Raspberry Pi.

The saga has several parts given its quite addictive difficulty. I tried the version 4 and is grateful that our Pi get games like this to enjoy and relax.

I leave the link to the web with all parts. Hope you enjoy!
