# News this week in the Pi World

![JabirOS](/images/2014/05/JabirOS-for-Raspberry-Pi.png)

Now we are one *Friday* closer to know my secret project (Can you tell I'm creating hype?). I give another clue at the end of the post.

Let's get to know the fresh news of the week:

* **JabirOS for Raspberry Pi:** Operating System based on *FreeBSD* to our beloved plate. The image occupies *1 GB* but doesn't contains the boot file *uboot* and have to get it yourself. | [jabirproject.org](http://jabirproject.org/embedded/jabiros-for-raspberry-pi)

* **AudiculaPi, distribution to use like a jukebox:** If you need to use the Pi for music, I think that this distribution with only **128 MB** is perfect to manage all your music through a web environment. *LIRC* and *Bluetooth* support. | [AudiculaPi - the little jukebox for your Raspberry Pi](http://sourceforge.net/projects/audiculapi/files/?source=navbar)


That's all for today. The clue that I will give you, is the name that the project will: **PiKISS**

We read!
