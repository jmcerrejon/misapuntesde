# News this week on the Pi World

![safe Pi](/images/2014/09/safePi.png)

Today I have been tempted and bought an *iPhone 6*. After three years with the version 4 I needed a renewal, mostly because my wife will inherit it and I do not like *Android* operating system. Hopefully someday *iOS* could be installed in other *Smartphones*. Moreover, in this section we'll see how to open a safe "by the face", *Perforce* (another *Dropbox killer*) and learn what the hell it *Shellshock* vulnerability.

- - -
* **Security camera with face recognition:** A good weekend project to have a safe  that is opened recognizing your face. Code available on *GitHub* if you want to modify it for other purposes. | [Makezine.com](http://makezine.com/projects/make-40/face-recognition-treasure-safe/)

* **Shellshock, learn to avoid it:** In short, it is a vulnerability in the *Shell Bash* that takes advantage of global variables. For a user like you and me it's not a big deal, but for servers and big business can endanger a lot of valuable information. If you want to know if your computer is vulnerable, run the following:

```bash
env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
```

If you get an error, your computer is safe.

To fix it:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade bashï»¿
```

* **Setting up Perforce on a Raspberry Pi:** It is basically a file server with *Git* power to manage large files in collaborative environments at any scale development. | [A Pocketful of Perforce: Perforce Services Setting Up on a Raspberry Pi](http://www.perforce.com/blog/140922/setting-perforce-services-raspberry-pi)

* **File Hosting with Seafile:** It seems that one of the things that most interests the Raspberry Pi users is to have personal files without having them in services like *Dropbox* because each day internet is more insecure. *Seafile* is another alternative if you think *ownCloud* does not work well enough. | [Pihomeserver.fr> Raspberry Pi Home Server - File hosting with Seafile](http://www.pihomeserver.fr/en/2014/09/24/raspberry-pi-home-server-hebergement-fichier-seafile/)

Happy weekend!
