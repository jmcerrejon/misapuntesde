# Pi Entertainment System (PES)

![PES](/images/2014/09/pes.png)

_PES_ is a graphical front end for a variety of games console emulators that has been written in _Python by Neil Munday_ which is intended for use on the _Raspberry Pi_.

Although _Java_ is still the programming language most widely used in spite of me and _Python_ is rising as the years go because of their community and their simplicity, are lenguages I would not use in my projects, and less one that should be a fast _Front-End_ to load _ROMs_ emulators.

Still deserves a chance. The image weighs a little already. Tell me what you think in the comments.
