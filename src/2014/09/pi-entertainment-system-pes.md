# Pi Entertainment System (PES)

![PES](/images/2014/09/pes.png)

*PES* is a graphical front end for a variety of games console emulators that has been written in *Python by Neil Munday* which is intended for use on the *Raspberry Pi*.

- - -
Although *Java* is still the programming language most widely used in spite of me and *Python* is rising as the years go because of their community and their simplicity, are lenguages I would not use in my projects, and less one that should be a fast *Front-End* to load *ROMs* emulators.

Still deserves a chance. The image weighs a little already. Tell me what you think in the comments.
