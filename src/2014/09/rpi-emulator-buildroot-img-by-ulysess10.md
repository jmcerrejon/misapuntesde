# rpi-emulator-buildroot .img by @ulysess10

I commented recently that I adore this initiative to have a _kernel_ which boot emulators super fast. If you read my blog you know that [Richard Howell](https://github.com/rmaz) is doing that happens, but some users are not cleared with the method to copy the boot and root. For them I have prepared a _.img_ file of **140 MB** size only for you to try it...

I loaded two homebrew games for _SNES and Game Boy Advance_ that are completely legal. If you want to add yours, put inside the **/usr/share/roms** folder.
