# LiveCode RC1 7.0 now on Raspberry Pi

![LiveCode logo](/images/2014/09/livecode_logo.png)

_LiveCode_ is a programming environment for humans that allow you to develop your cross-platform applications with minimal effort. If you want to see how it is, I'll show it in the video below...

The new version 7.0 has been released for _Raspberry Pi_. Whether you're a developer or not, this environment will facilitate the task as it is a drag and drop system. On the web you can find guides and as I have seen, is very simple. It reminds me of other visual IDEs, although based on a natural language for programming. Here's an example:

```bash
on mouseUp
   answer "Hello World!"
end mouseUp
```

There is a free version called _Community_ and other payment if you are creating an application for commercial purposes.
