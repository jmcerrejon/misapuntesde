# New release of Raspbian (& NOOBS too)

![Raspbian](/images/raspbian.jpg)

A few days ago The RPi Foundation upload a new version of the official OS *Raspbian* and the OS installer *NOOBS*. If you want to know what's new on this release, you can read the full post.

For those who are looking forward to change repos from *Wheezy* to *Jessie*, we will have to wait a little longer.

* Epiphany browser

* Switch to Java 8 from Java 7

* New firmware

* Minecraft Pi pre-installed

* Sonic Pi upgraded to 2.0

If you want to upgrade your actual Raspbian distro:

```bash
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```
