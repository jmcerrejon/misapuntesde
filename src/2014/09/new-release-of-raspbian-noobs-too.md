# New release of Raspbian (& NOOBS too)

![Raspbian](/images/raspbian.jpg)

A few days ago The RPi Foundation upload a new version of the official OS _Raspbian_ and the OS installer _NOOBS_. If you want to know what's new on this release, you can read the full post.

For those who are looking forward to change repos from _Wheezy_ to _Jessie_, we will have to wait a little longer.

-   Epiphany browser

-   Switch to Java 8 from Java 7

-   New firmware

-   Minecraft Pi pre-installed

-   Sonic Pi upgraded to 2.0

If you want to upgrade your actual Raspbian distro:

```bash
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```
