# Talk: What do I want a Raspberry Pi?

![Betabeer](/images/2014/09/capture_bb.png)

As I mentioned in my last post, on *Friday* I gave a talk in my hometown about the Raspberry Pi and I've spent the last three days adding english subtitles. I leave the link to the video on *Youtube* and any comments, you know.

I thank [raspipc.es](http://raspipc.es) for give us one Kit with a Raspberry Pi to gift in the event.
