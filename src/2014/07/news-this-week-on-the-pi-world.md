Week holidays, but I have taken a moment to provide some links that I have found interesting.

Here we go!...

* **3.2" touch screen panel for 25 &euro; on *DealExtreme*?.** Another one 2.5" for just 15 &euro;? Mmm... [Dealextreme: Wareshare Raspberry Pi 3.2" LCD Resistive Screen Module ](http://www.dx.com/p/wareshare-raspberry-pi-3-2-lcd-resistive-screen-module-331243#.U9NlptaY6ze) | [Dealextreme: 
MZTX-PI-EXT 2.5" IPS Full Angle LCD Display Extension Board Module for Raspberry Pi - Green ](http://www.dx.com/p/mztx-pi-ext-2-5-ips-full-angle-lcd-display-extension-board-module-for-raspberry-pi-green-331576#.U9NnCdaY6zc)

* **Arch-WiPi: Turn your Raspberry Pi into a wireless router/AP (SD image)**  | [Sourceforge: Arch-WiPi (448.6 MB)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/archwipi/)

* **SSH Config (Youtube):** This is not another video tutorial to connect over SSH. I recommend especially the second part, where it explain how to use remotely a graphical desktop application via SSH [Youtube: Setup SSH - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KqGRlVIG3w) | [Youtube: Setup SSH - Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9qsWQGGo_U)
