The highlight:

-   Dual step-down (buck) power supply for 3.3V and 1.8V

-   5V supply has polarity protection, 2A fuse and hot-swap protection

-   New USB/Ethernet controller chip

-   40 GPIO pins instead of 26. The top/first 26 pins match the original layout, 9 additional GPIO and 2 EEPROM Plate identification pins

-   4 USB ports instead of 2 ports

-   Composite (NTSC/PAL) video now integrated into 4-pole 3.5mm 'headphone' jack

-   MicroSD card socket instead of full size SD

-   Four mounting holes in rectangular layout

-   Many connectors moved around
