# ScoutBot: Penetration testers for Raspberry Pi (IMG)

![ScoutBot](/images/2014/10/scoutbot.png)

_ScoutBot is a must have application for penetration testers who are looking for an easy and inconspicuous way of gathering info on a target's network._

---

_Built for the Raspberry Pi, this powerful script automates complex footprinting and reconnaissance tasks. While you enjoy a cup of coffee sitting next to that open Ethernet port ScoutBot could be scanning the network or sniffing the traffic, all without the need for a keyboard or monitor._

Here are some of the features:

-   Scans the target network for open ports

-   Identifies Windows environments

-   Identifies dynamic routing protocols

-   Identifies devices by scanning with SNMP

-   Identifies DHCP servers and their advertised scopes

-   Checks egress filtering

-   Identifies the network's outside IP address

-   Performs a WHOIS to identify ISP

-   Performs a traceroute to the outside

-   Accepts static IP addresses

-   Accepts DHCP

-   Pre-configure for a completely automated attack

-   Works on any Raspberry Pi, no setup necessary

-   Free

Basically, you pre-configure the scan and then just plug the Raspberry Pi into the target network. This tool comes as a preloaded IMG which is ready to use.
