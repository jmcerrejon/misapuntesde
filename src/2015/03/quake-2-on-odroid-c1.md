# Quake 2 on ODROID-C1

![quake2](/images/2013/09/quake2.jpg)

We could already play **Quake 2 on the PI** a couple of years ago as [I told you](/post.php?id=259). Now I wanted to do the same with the *ODROID-C1* board and to be easy for you, I've added it to the [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS/blob/dc9c450b5fe88affc70196b1ec0f5b14c520f3bb/scripts/games/quake.sh) repository. Now your fingers are save.

I want to thanks to *Meveric* for help to me with the ODROID-C1 support in [this thread](http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=6471&p=80266#p80266) of the forum.
