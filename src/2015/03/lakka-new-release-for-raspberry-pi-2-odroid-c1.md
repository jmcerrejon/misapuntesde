On all platforms aspects such as shaders, cores and update packages are improved.

Raspberry Pi 2:

* New snes9x-next, with better sound and compatibility

Known bugs:

* Launching RetroArch is slow (10+ sec)

* Launchin a game is slow (10+ sec)

* The menu is laggy (30fps)

* No audio on the N64 emulator

ODROID-C1:

* snes9x-next & pcsx_rearmed works flawlessly

Known bugs:

* No vsync, so there is some tearing on some games

* No N64 emulation, it segfaults on launch

* The menu is too fast (130fps)

You can see videos for both platforms in the next link.
