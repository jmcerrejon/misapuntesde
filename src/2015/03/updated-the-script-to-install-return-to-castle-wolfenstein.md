# Updated the script to install Return to Castle Wolfenstein

Yesterday I had to check this game, and I was impressed with the performance on a *Raspberry Pi 2*. Is noticeable when loading each level. You need **assign to the GPU at least 160 GB**.

You can download the script from [PiKISS > rwolf.sh](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS/raw/d75c2f59233d93f6f10ce59fd9eb432d06863bba/scripts/games/rwolf.sh)
