# PiKISS will add support for ODROID-C1

For those who do not know, [PiKISS](/post.php?id=409) are a bunch of scripts that I'm developing for the community. It lets you install software from a menu that is not in the repositories or compile it for you, easily configure static ip or your *WIFI*, mount a web server in minutes with little effort, among others. You will no longer need to write a command to the most tedious tasks.

I wanted to comment that soon I'll add **support for ODROID-C1** and more specifically  *Ubuntu*. I started refactoring the main code of the menu, so if you have it installed, I suggest that you run **git pull** to update.
