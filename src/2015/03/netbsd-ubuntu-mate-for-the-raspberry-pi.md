# NetBSD & Ubuntu Mate for the Raspberry Pi

![Ubuntu MATE](/images/2015/03/ubuntu_mate.png)

The Raspi has new OS, and now we are with ARMv7 seems that many distributions are thinking of a port and not just for our favorite board...

- - -
For *NetBSD*, the port comes both for the Pi and *ODROID-C1*. In [this link](http://nyftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/netbsd-7/) you will find the latest stable version for the Pi. The funny thing is that they have optimized the operating system to use the *GPU* and support *omxplayer, OpenGL ES, Quake 3 or RetroArch*. Deserves a chance.

With *NetBSD for ODROID-C1* is almost a piece of artisan and we must build image for ourselves. At least it's a start.

*Ubuntu MATE 15.04 for Raspberry Pi 2* is based on the image of *Ubuntu ARM* (no *Snappy Core*) and still is a very early version, although fans of this distribution will see more progress over the month. I hope it will get support to the *GPU* to play videos.

[CentOS](http://seven.centos.org/2015/03/centos-linux-7-and-arm/) community is working in a version to *Pi2* and *ODROID-C1* that we hope to see soon.
