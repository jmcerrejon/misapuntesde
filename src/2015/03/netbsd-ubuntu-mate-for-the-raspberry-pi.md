# NetBSD & Ubuntu Mate for the Raspberry Pi

![Ubuntu MATE](/images/2015/03/ubuntu_mate.png)

The Raspi has new OS, and now we are with ARMv7 seems that many distributions are thinking of a port and not just for our favorite board...

---

For _NetBSD_, the port comes both for the Pi and _ODROID-C1_. In [this link](https://nyftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/netbsd-7/) you will find the latest stable version for the Pi. The funny thing is that they have optimized the operating system to use the _GPU_ and support _omxplayer, OpenGL ES, Quake 3 or RetroArch_. Deserves a chance.

With _NetBSD for ODROID-C1_ is almost a piece of artisan and we must build image for ourselves. At least it's a start.

_Ubuntu MATE 15.04 for Raspberry Pi 2_ is based on the image of _Ubuntu ARM_ (no _Snappy Core_) and still is a very early version, although fans of this distribution will see more progress over the month. I hope it will get support to the _GPU_ to play videos.

[CentOS](https://seven.centos.org/2015/03/centos-linux-7-and-arm/) community is working in a version to _Pi2_ and _ODROID-C1_ that we hope to see soon.
