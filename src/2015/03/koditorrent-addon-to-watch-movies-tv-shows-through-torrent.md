# KODITorrent: Addon to watch movies & TV Shows through Torrent

![Kmediatorrent](/images/2015/03/Kmediatorrent.png)

*Popcorn Time, Movie Box, TorrentTv, Flixtor*,... are many and varied our options for streaming through the *torrent* protocol.

By chance I found this *add-on* that works perfectly on the *Raspberry Pi* and allow uncomplicated access to an extensive catalog with **720,1080 and even 3D qualities**...

I had already comment on some occasion [these alternatives](/post.php?id=474), but don't gave me the expected result.

The menus are loaded faster on a *Raspberry Pi 2* with no overclock. I've tested with *OpenELEC 5.0.6* and usually **takes about 40 seconds with a 20 Mbps** connection to load on buffer.
