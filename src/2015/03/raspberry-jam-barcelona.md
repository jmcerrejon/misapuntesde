# Raspberry Jam Barcelona

![Raspberry Jam](/images/2015/03/raspberry_jam.png)

**For the first time**, we will have a **Raspberry Jam in Spain**. This event is made to attend any curious to know firsthand interesting projects about _software, hardware, robotics, retro machines, home automation_...

It's your chance to meet the best **"Makers" in Spain and UK**, in which **I will be present giving a talk**.

It will be a day to enjoy and learn a lot from our beloved Pi and other boards that are setting trends. There will also be raffles.

The entrance, all the conferences and workshops **are free**. You can now sign (limited capacity) in the following link:
