**Attract mode** shows a menu to choose emulators quite attractive, as its name suggests.

In the image found on the forums, you can run both on a *Raspberry Pi 1* or a *Raspberry Pi 2*. Has Joystick support via *GPIO*, and much more...

It has several languages and is multiplatform. It comes with *MAME* and with typical features as a simple adjustable system configuration from a text file, support different types of image formats and even video, mapping buttons, etc.
