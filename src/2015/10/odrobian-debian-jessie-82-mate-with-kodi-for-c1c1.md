# (Odrobian) Debian Jessie 8.2 MATE with KODI for C1/C1+

![Odrobian](/images/2015/10/odrobian_02.png)

I admit, I've been a fan of *Ubuntu* from its early versions, but makes a couple of versions that I do not use. As good *Distro Hopper*, I've been changing my operating system both *iMac* and the *RPI/ODROID*, and I have a list of favorites. Among them has always been *Debian*, and today I found this gem developed by another admirer of *C1/XU4* like me. Let's meet **Odrobian**.

*Odrobian* is a **Debian Jessie 8.2** image with *Mate Desktop Environment* all accelerated by *Mali-X11* drivers and overclockable easily through simple commands. Some special features are:

* Kodi 15.2 with OpenGLESv2 along with AMlogic VPU optimizations.

* Chromium Browser v45 accelerated with GLshim 1.5 wrapper.

* Odroid Official Repositories.

* USB auto-mount.

* Uncompressed image size: 1.95GB.

* Overclocking commands: overclock-boast (1.7Ghz), overclock-med (1.8Ghz), overclock-high (1.9Ghz), overclock-turbo (2.0Ghz).
