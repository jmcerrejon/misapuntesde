# (Odrobian) Debian Jessie 8.2 MATE with KODI for C1/C1+

![Odrobian](/images/2015/10/odrobian_02.png)

I admit, I've been a fan of _Ubuntu_ from its early versions, but makes a couple of versions that I do not use. As good _Distro Hopper_, I've been changing my operating system both _iMac_ and the _RPI/ODROID_, and I have a list of favorites. Among them has always been _Debian_, and today I found this gem developed by another admirer of _C1/XU4_ like me. Let's meet **Odrobian**.
