# Q4OS: Windows look style for Rasberry Pi

![Q4OS](/images/2015/10/xpq4.jpg)

**Q4OS** is a _Linux_ distribution based on _Debian + KDE_ whith the main characteristic of copying the look of _Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 7 or Windows 8.1_, and is available for **Raspberry Pi**.

It comes packaged in _.esh_ (_Extended Shell Batch files_), so you will need to decompress _Windows_. It has two versions, with or without propietary icons.

If someone test it, you can comment below and give us your feedback.
