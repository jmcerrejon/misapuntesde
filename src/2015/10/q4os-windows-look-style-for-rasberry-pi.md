# Q4OS: Windows look style for Rasberry Pi

![Q4OS](/images/2015/10/xpq4.jpg)

**Q4OS** is a *Linux* distribution based on *Debian + KDE*  whith the main characteristic of copying the look of *Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 7 or Windows 8.1*, and is available for **Raspberry Pi**.

It comes packaged in *.esh* (*Extended Shell Batch files*), so you will need to decompress *Windows*. It has two versions, with or without propietary icons.

If someone test it, you can comment below and give us your feedback.
