# New XU3/4 Mali GPU driver for FBDEV on ODROID

![EmulationStation](/images/emulationstation.png)

*ARM* has released new drivers *r6p0* with *DMA Buffer* and *VSync* support. It is not yet available in the official *repositories*, but users who compiled it have reached...**450fps!** (From *20fps* achieved with the previous driver *r5p1*). Want to see how it moves the Soul Calibur to *60fps* on a *ODROID XU4*?...

For now there is not support for *Wayland* and *X11*. Enabling *VSync* we get *60fps* on *Emulation Station*.
