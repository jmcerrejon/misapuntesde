# New XU3/4 Mali GPU driver for FBDEV on ODROID

![EmulationStation](/images/emulationstation.png)

_ARM_ has released new drivers _r6p0_ with _DMA Buffer_ and _VSync_ support. It is not yet available in the official _repositories_, but users who compiled it have reached...**450fps!** (From _20fps_ achieved with the previous driver _r5p1_). Want to see how it moves the Soul Calibur to _60fps_ on a _ODROID XU4_?...

For now there is not support for _Wayland_ and _X11_. Enabling _VSync_ we get _60fps_ on _Emulation Station_.
