# Raylib videogames library v. 1.3 released

![Raylib](/images/2015/01/raylib_logo.png)

I [commented](/post.php?id=507) this *open-source library* created by a teacher to his students. It will help you easily create video games in C.

I am glad to know that continue its development quite actively, and with some new features on the new version 1.3:

- - -
* Now with raylib you can code your games in C and compile for Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, RaspberryPi and HTML5.

* Shaders support for easy shaders loading and use. Loaded shaders can be attached to 3d models or used as fullscreen postrocessing effects. A bunch of postprocessing shaders are also included in this release, check raylib/shaders folder.

* Textures module has grown to support most of the internal texture formats available in OpenGL (RGB565, RGB888, RGBA5551, RGBA4444, etc.), including compressed texture formats (DXT, ETC1, ETC2, ASTC, PVRT); raylib 1.3 can load .dds, .pkm, .ktx, .astc and .pvr files.

* New camera module offers to the user multiple preconfigured ready-to-use camera systems (free camera, 1st person, 3rd person). Camera modes are very easy to use, just check examples: core_3d_camera_free.c and core_3d_camera_first_person.c.

* New gestures module simplifies gestures detection on Android and HTML5 programs.

* raygui, the new IMGUI (Immediate Mode GUI) module offers a set of functions to create simple user interfaces, primary intended for tools development. It's still in experimental state but already fully functional.
