One of the most interesting websites to take advantage of the multimedia skills of your Pi is undoubtedly [htpcguides.com](https://www.htpcguides.com/). They have released a distribution with everything you need to serve and download media files.

Technical specifications:

-   vsftpd for FTP Server

-   NFS included in v6

-   Samba for creating samba shares

-   SickRage for periodic show downloading

-   CouchPotato for feature length video downloading

-   Transmission as BitTorrent client

-   NZBGet for usenet downloading

-   Plex Media Server for streaming video

One of the apps that I want to "play" and automatically download my favorite TV shows via _torrent_ is [SickRage](https://github.com/SiCKRAGETV/SickRage) or [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/). Recently I was asked by email and I have never used my RPI for these purposes, since I use to download [uploaded.net](https://ul.to/ref/8900882), for me the King undisputed in this type of service.

Are you interested in a tutorial about automatic downloads of your favorite TV Shows?
