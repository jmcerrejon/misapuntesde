# OpenELEC by pikomnule

![kodi](/images/kodi.png)

I found in a forum about **OpenELEC, a flavor based on the latest version 5.0.8** that comes with a few extras already included. Let's see what addons are preinstalled...

- - -
* LIBRTMP updated to March 2015

* Addons included (Updated to the latest version available 05/01/2015): Pelicalacarta, Tvalacarta, P2P-Stream, Press (for torrents), f4mTester and F4mProxy (Required for F4M channels), Sportdevils.

* Required 2 GB SD card or higher.

* Default resolution 1280x720 on start

* Unforced HDMI output.

* Enable display hidden files and directories.

* Enabled allow renamed and deleted files.

* Disable RSS.

* Moderate overclocking (Only Raspberry Pi 1 A, B and B +): arm_freq goes from 700 to 800 mhz, core_freq goes from 250 to 300 mhz.

The truth is that I only use to install two addons on XBMC: *pelisalacarta* and *Youtube*. What are your favorites addons?
