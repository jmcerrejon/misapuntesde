# LinkedIn help you to find a job

![LinkedIn](/images/2015/05/linkedin.jpg)

As you know, I am a freelance for a year and a half. Here in Spain and especially in my city, is difficult to find a job as Developer/Computer engineer being freelance and if so, is having contacts that "hold" you every month. So maybe it is time to seek paid employment.

I do not usually use *LinkedIn* (if you're curious, [here](http://es.linkedin.com/in/jmcerrejon/) is my profile in this network), but today I found that it have a fantastic searcher. If I want to focus on finding a job that makes use of my skills with *Raspberry Pi*, you can get a list with some companies interested in people with this knowledge, which today does not surprise me.

So if you want a job, you know that this social network can help you.

You're welcome.
