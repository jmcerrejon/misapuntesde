# News this week on Pi/ODROID World

![ODROID Mayo](/images/2015/05/odroid_mag_may.png)

This week has been much movement in terms of new boards. _CHIP_, with a cost of $9 (hopefully lower their shipping costs now that they **have surpassed the million dollars on Kickstarter**) has been the most we liked.

We can already can read the new issue of the _ODROID MAGAZINE_ where **I have published an article about how to install Quake II in ODROID**. But... There's more!...

-   **ODROID MAGAZINE May:** I could say that my article about _Quake II_ is the best of the magazine, but I would lie: Install a classic RPG like _Arx Fatalis_ (you will see a script to also install it in the Pi2 soon), emulate the _Nintendo 64_ or build a _Dashboard_ to keep informed, are among the best you'll find in this great magazine | [magazine.odroid.com](https://magazine.odroid.com)

Happy weekend!
