Here's my intervention in _Raspberry JAM_ held this past Saturday in Barcelona. I think it sounds good, but sometimes leave the plane due the fixed camera, sorry.

I would have to thank everyone who visit us and to Ferran Fabregas [(projectlog.ferranfabregas.info)](https://projectlog.ferranfabregas.info), her mate Manuela, as well as Antonio Monaco Osado [(peatonet.com)](https://peatonet.com) and Karla. So glad to do a thousand kilometers ;)

Thank you!

**PS:** If someone is interested in this video subtitled into English, just tell me in the comments.
