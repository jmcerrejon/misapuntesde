# ArchPhile for Raspberry Pi

![ArchPhile](/images/2015/04/archphile_logo.png)

We have unofficial *Raspberry Pi* distros to try one every day for a month. This week we saw [DietPi](/post.php?id=545) and now I'll show you another OS called **Archphile**, based on *Arch Linux* with some very interesting features that competes directly with solutions like *Volumio*.
