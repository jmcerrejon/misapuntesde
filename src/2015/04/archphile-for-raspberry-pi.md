# ArchPhile for Raspberry Pi

![ArchPhile](/images/2015/04/archphile_logo.png)

We have unofficial _Raspberry Pi_ distros to try one every day for a month. This week we saw [DietPi](/post.php?id=545) and now I'll show you another OS called **Archphile**, based on _Arch Linux_ with some very interesting features that competes directly with solutions like _Volumio_.
