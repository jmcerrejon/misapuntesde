# Ubuntu 15.04 released!

![Ubuntu_Vivit](/images/2015/04/ubuntu_vivit.png)

Right now I'm trying out the final version of _Ubuntu_ operating system that has accompanied me many years, but maybe this is the latest version that I'm trying...

Link Yo download:

-   [i386](https://releases.ubuntu.com/vivid/ubuntu-15.04-desktop-i386.iso)

-   [x64](https://releases.ubuntu.com/vivid/ubuntu-15.04-desktop-amd64.iso)

A few things to remember you: The first is that [here](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/scripts/blob/master/burn.sh) you can get a script to burn the image to a _USB disc_ or _SD card_ from _OSX Terminal_. As simple as run **./burn.sh ubuntu-15.04-desktop-i386.iso** and forget about convert the image Yo .img,etc...

Another thing is that I updated the _Ubuntu Google Docs_ [here](https://goo.gl/63X0p) where I have collected several post-installation steps.

Runs very slowly on a _NetBook with 2 GB RAM_, so erasing in 3..2..1

Before commented that perhaps this is the last _Ubuntu_ I use as operating system, because **Debian Jessie** will be with us this weekend, and I think it's gonna be a version that will be worth try.
