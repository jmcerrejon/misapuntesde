# Android Lollipop 5 on Raspberry Pi 2

![Lollipop](/images/2015/04/lollipop.png)

Many wondered when reading [this post](/post.php?id=547), if it was true that we could run _Android 5_ on our beloved Pi2. A user has dared to compile and teaches us how to get it...

The truth is that there is no secret. As you can see in the video above, does not run as well as they should because of the hardware that has the Pi 2, but it's a start. I guess it still will not support hardware acceleration properly.

What we get before running in our Pi, a decent version of _Android_ or _Windows 10_?
