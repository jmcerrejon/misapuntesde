# Thinking about Windows 10

![win10](/images/2015/04/win_rpi_r.png)

This week I want to change the section about the Pi World with some reflections about Windows...


**Microsoft is doing the things really well**. I remember the years from *Windows XP* and I could not understand what they were thinking when released [Windows Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me) (Do you remember *Millenium*, don't you?). Since then it was downhill and without brakes, and perhaps some saw the light  with *Windows 7*, but returned to the darkness with the *Touch* philosophy on Desktop and killing the *Start button*, but...

- - -
It seems *Microsoft* is looking for allies everywhere and in all communities. Some examples:

* **Windows 10 promises**. Tell you a user who went from *MSDOS* to *Windows*, then *Linux* and later *OSX*.

* [Continuum](http://www.slashgear.com/windows-10-continuum-turns-your-phone-into-a-pc-29381415/) for phones

* Browser [Edge](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/29/technology/microsoft-edge-windows-build/index.html?section=money_news_international) (late, but we'll see how it unfolds)

* Facilitate port applications from *Android/iOS* to *Windows 10*

* *Cortana* (*Siri's* boyfriend)

* [Visual Studio](http://www.genbetadev.com/herramientas/eramos-pocos-y-pario-microsoft-visual-studio-code) multiplatform

* Third-party apps developed with *HTML* and *JavaScript* to *Office*

* Windows Store

* Partnership with [Arduino](http://blog.arduino.cc/2015/04/30/microsoft-and-arduino-new-partnership/), the *Raspberry Pi Foundation*, and everything related with *IoT* ([+ info](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/Downloads.htm))



* [Project HoloLens](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/microsoft-hands-on/) to project objects through real elements. I loved it.

What's now?. They are giving us pills and being pulled new versions of everything I've commented. So we can only sit down and wait... What do you think about it?.

See ya in the comments...
