# Thinking about Windows 10

![win10](/images/2015/04/win_rpi_r.png)

This week I want to change the section about the Pi World with some reflections about Windows...

**Microsoft is doing the things really well**. I remember the years from _Windows XP_ and I could not understand what they were thinking when released [Windows Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me) (Do you remember _Millenium_, don't you?). Since then it was downhill and without brakes, and perhaps some saw the light with _Windows 7_, but returned to the darkness with the _Touch_ philosophy on Desktop and killing the _Start button_, but...

It seems _Microsoft_ is looking for allies everywhere and in all communities. Some examples:

-   **Windows 10 promises**. Tell you a user who went from _MSDOS_ to _Windows_, then _Linux_ and later _OSX_.

-   [Continuum](https://www.slashgear.com/windows-10-continuum-turns-your-phone-into-a-pc-29381415/) for phones

![Edge](/images/2015/04/Edge_r.png)

-   Browser [Edge](https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/29/technology/microsoft-edge-windows-build/index.html?section=money_news_international) (late, but we'll see how it unfolds)

-   Facilitate port applications from _Android/iOS_ to _Windows 10_

-   _Cortana_ (_Siri's_ boyfriend)

-   [Visual Studio](https://www.genbetadev.com/herramientas/eramos-pocos-y-pario-microsoft-visual-studio-code) multiplatform

-   Third-party apps developed with _HTML_ and _JavaScript_ to _Office_

-   Windows Store

-   Partnership with [Arduino](https://blog.arduino.cc/2015/04/30/microsoft-and-arduino-new-partnership/), the _Raspberry Pi Foundation_, and everything related with _IoT_ ([+ info](https://ms-iot.github.io/content/Downloads.htm))

-   [Project HoloLens](https://www.wired.com/2015/01/microsoft-hands-on/) to project objects through real elements. I loved it.

What's now?. They are giving us pills and being pulled new versions of everything I've commented. So we can only sit down and wait... What do you think about it?.

See ya in the comments...
