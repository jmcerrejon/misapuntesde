# Fixing PiKISS

![PiKISS](/images/2015/04/piKiss.png)

I spend all day fixing **PiKISS** to the talk on the next week. I just wanted to comment in case you want to make a **git pull**.

Not only have corrections, some links failed, added new scripts and the damn error with the *SDL* libraries to which *Raspbian* has not yet uploaded an official solution... Hopefully not be too long.
