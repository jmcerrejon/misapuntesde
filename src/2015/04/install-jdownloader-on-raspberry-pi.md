# Install jdownloader on Raspberry Pi

![jDownloader](/images/2015/04/jdownloader.png)
 
 I do not usually use the *Pi* for my daily downloads, but I discovered that many of you it does: *torrent*, *Emule*, and few use hosters as *Freakshare* or [uploaded](http://ul.to/ref/8900882). Today we will install *jDownloader* on the Raspberry Pi.

*jDownloader*, for those who do not know, is a cross-platform download manager developed with *Java*, which supports downloading through different hosters or direct download servers. As I said previously [here](/post.php?id=239), usually use [plowshare](https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare) (recently migrated from *Google Code* to *GitHub*) and sometimes the program is now mentioned, one of the best known.

Raad the next guide published by *Draco* in his blog *informaticamateur.blogspot.com.es*.
