# Install jdownloader on Raspberry Pi

![jDownloader](/images/2015/04/jdownloader.png)

I do not usually use the _Pi_ for my daily downloads, but I discovered that many of you it does: _torrent_, _Emule_, and few use hosters as _Freakshare_ or [uploaded](https://ul.to/ref/8900882). Today we will install _jDownloader_ on the Raspberry Pi.

_jDownloader_, for those who do not know, is a cross-platform download manager developed with _Java_, which supports downloading through different hosters or direct download servers. As I said previously [here](/post.php?id=239), usually use [plowshare](https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare) (recently migrated from _Google Code_ to _GitHub_) and sometimes the program is now mentioned, one of the best known.
