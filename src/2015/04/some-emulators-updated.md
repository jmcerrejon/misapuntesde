Some emulators updated

Long time I had not entered my favorite section of the *raspberrypi.org* forums: Games. Today I found several updates and some additions did not know, like an *Amstrad CPC* emulator coming with an *Alpha* version very promissing...

Emulators have updated their binaries are:

* **Unreal Speccy Portable (ZX Spectrum)**, in version 0.064 includes the following improvements: gamepad support, able to browse files inside *.zip* archives,**.szx/.rzx/.fdi support**,memory leaks, uninitialized vars, etc. fixed | [bitbucket.org > Unreal Speccy Portable](https://bitbucket.org/djdron/unrealspeccyp/downloads)

* **uae4all2 (Amiga)**, Compiled by *Chips*, this version bring **CPU frequency beyond 28 MHz**, you can adjust the resolution by parameters and supports new joysticks. | [raspberrypi.org forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=78&t=102328)

![Picodrive](/images/picodrive_new.png)

* **Picodrive 1.91 by Chips**. Looks like this guy work hard to improve emulators that we already had. Good for him (and for us). In this case, he improve *Picodrive* compiled by *Notaz* with *dynarec* activated and **OpenGL ES upscaling**. | [foro raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=78&t=105811)

![Amstrad](/images/amstrad.png)

* **CapriceRPI2 (Amstrad CPC)** is an *Amstrad CPC* emulator ported by a Spanish guy using **scaling GPU hardware** and to be a first version looks pretty good. Valid for *Raspberry Pi 2* only. | [amstrad.es](http://www.amstrad.es/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=3878)

Of course, I've updated and added these emulators to [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS) along with some games so you don't have to fight a lot when installing.

Enjoy!
