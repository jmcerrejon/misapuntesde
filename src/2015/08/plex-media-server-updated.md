# Plex Media Server updated

![Plex](/images/2015/08/plex_logo.png)

It is the first time I have perfectly ordered and cataloged my <del>movies, series and music collection</del> home videos. *Plex* has become the solution for comfortable viewing from any device on my home, I store the content with a very powerful and useful visual environment. Recently it updated, and these are their improvements:

- - -
* Versi√≥n 0.9.12.11.1406

* Fix the local media agent not starting correctly

* Fix a possible crash when updating premium music libraries

* Fix an issue that caused remuxing and audio conversion on some ARMv7 and PPC platforms to fail

To upgrade, either on a *Raspberry Pi or ODROID*, you must do it manually in case of using a *Debian system*. For *Arch Linux* only need to run: **pacman -Syu**
