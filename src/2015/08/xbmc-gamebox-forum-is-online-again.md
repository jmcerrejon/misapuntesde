# XBMC Gamebox forum is online again

![GameBox](/images/2014/12/gamebox-logo.png)


In December last year, the company *Xindawn* caught the attention of all of us by creating a system offering **Airplay mirroring for Raspberry Pi**, and really worked very well. I put my impressions in a [post](/post.php?id=490) and It was offline for a long time.

It seems to be online again so you can download the software for *Raspbian* version. Maybe its the time to make a copy before they disappear again...
