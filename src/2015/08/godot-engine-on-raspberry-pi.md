# Godot Engine on Raspberry Pi

![Godot_logo.jpg](/images/2015/08/Godot_logo.jpg)

One of the passions (frustrated) I have since childhood, is the creation of video games. You can read an article [here](/post.php?id=519) I wrote a while.

I have tested several engines looking for maximum portability to all platforms. *SDL* has always been the best choice, but I have little more than a year watching the progress of a game engine called **Godot Engine** that has nothing to envy to *Unity* or *Game Maker*, and it works. The best, the user *x1212* is porting the engine to the *Raspberry Pi* with surprising results (See the video below)...

In the video you can see above, it is admirable to see the speed when running 2D games. It is also not so bad in 3D, but presumably it will improve. Think that is not easy to run in a X window content directly from the *GPU*.

Forgive my enthusiasm, but since it went public this engine, I have dreamed that I could run on the *Raspberry Pi*. It allows import from *Blender* your models and has a whole environment to create your own video games with a programming language adapted called *GDScript*. With a community on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/godotengine/) where you can chat with the developers and other developers. In [this](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1541&start=10) thread you can see the progress being made to our beloved Pi.

I leave the executable for *Raspbian* compiled by the guy who made the video. From here I give to this user my congratulations and I hope that in the future, this engine have official support from *OKAM Studio*.
