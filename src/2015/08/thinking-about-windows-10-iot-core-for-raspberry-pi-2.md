# Thinking about Windows 10 IoT Core for Raspberry Pi 2

![Win](/images/2015/04/win_rpi_r.png)

With the arrival of _Windows 10_ on your desktop, we had almost forgotten the leap it has made in a few months in the world of development boards. Not what we expected, because having _Windows_ desktop in our beloved _Raspberrys_ is elusive dream, but we must not underestimate the great work they are doing with _Windows 10 IoT Core_, which today will reflect a little.

As much to say that its _Core_ has been released, it is still a beta and still take to get a stable version from the official website of _Windows > IoT_ can be seen the projects being developed for the _Internet of things_: Weather Stations, robot kits, accelerometers...

What is interesting, firstly fusion hardware we all know, with development environments that have accompanied us throughout life as _Visual Studio_. They give us everything so you can develop an ecosystem that just works.

In this post I will collect interesting articles to use _Windows Core_. I recommend that all of this technology not lose sight, because the future as I see, is wearable devices, and especially the _IoT_ that fortunately you know what means, and most people walking watching a screen in their hands, not yet.
