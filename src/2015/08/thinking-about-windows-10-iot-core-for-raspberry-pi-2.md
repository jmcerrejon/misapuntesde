# Thinking about Windows 10 IoT Core for Raspberry Pi 2

![Win](/images/2015/04/win_rpi_r.png)

With the arrival of *Windows 10* on your desktop, we had almost forgotten the leap it has made in a few months in the world of development boards. Not what we expected, because having *Windows* desktop in our beloved *Raspberrys* is elusive dream, but we must not underestimate the great work they are doing with *Windows 10 IoT Core*, which today will reflect a little.

As much to say that its *Core* has been released, it is still a beta and still take to get a stable version from the official website of *Windows > IoT* can be seen the projects being developed for the *Internet of things*: Weather Stations, robot kits, accelerometers...

What is interesting, firstly fusion hardware we all know, with development environments that have accompanied us throughout life as *Visual Studio*. They give us everything so you can develop an ecosystem that just works.

In this post I will collect interesting articles to use *Windows Core*. I recommend that all of this technology not lose sight, because the future as I see, is wearable devices, and especially the *IoT* that fortunately you know what means, and most people walking watching a screen in their hands, not yet.
