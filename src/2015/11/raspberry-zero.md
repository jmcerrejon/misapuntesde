*Paul Ward* comment: *"UK market will support the product, it is $5 for the US market which equates to &pound;3.31 on today's exchange rate on EX. But what a surprise I went to element 14 site and the cost of the PI ZERO for the UK market is &pound;11.88 and the Pi Hut is &pound;16. So if the PI is $5 Element 14's price pays for three and the PI hut is close on the price for 5. It is fantastic saying you have a $5 PI so why are you not selling it for $5 or &pound;5 that would be something."*
