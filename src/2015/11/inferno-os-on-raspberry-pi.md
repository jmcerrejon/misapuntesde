# Inferno OS on Raspberry Pi

![inferno OS](/images/2014/03/Inferno_os.png)

I recognize that for many years tried almost all operating systems and even donated money to one called [SkyOS](http://www.skyos.org) who promised an awesome OS for the time (2009) although it was forgotten. I also remember one that fit on a floppy programmed in assembly called [MenuetOS](http://www.menuetos.net) and today continues its development.

*Inferno* remember me to those operating systems but hey, I'll tell you a little about that after the jump ...

Created by the company [Bell Labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) and now maintained by [Vita Nuova Holdings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vita_Nuova_Holdings), offers an *RTOS* environment that can be adapted to any computer. *Limbo* is used as a language and is based on three principles: **Resources as files**: all resources are represented as files in a hierarchical system, **Namespaces** and **standard communication protocol** called *Styx* to access files on local or remote.

A company has compiled *Inferno OS* for the Pi. Although it's an *Alpha*, you can already try it but you can't do anything with it, because the mouse still does not work.
