# Exagear Desktop release v1.2

![Exagear](/images/2015/06/ExaGear_Desktop_tr.png)

Eltechs has contacted me to inform you that has come a new version of this program that I commented [here](/post.php?id=573). This is a program for virtualizing x86 Linux applications on ARM processors. New features after the jump.

* We enhanced integration of host ARM and guest x86 systems. Now shortcut of installed x86 app is automatically placed on Desktop/Start-Menu and you can run it directly from Desktop/Start-Menu just by clicking on it the same way as native ARM app.

* Of course we supported new Raspbian released Sep 24 based on Debian 8 "Jessie" and provide Debian 8 "Jessie" guest image.

* Also we added support for Ubuntu 15.04 and Debian 8. Corresponding guest images are also available. 

* We are continuing to work on performance. This time we focused on hard applications. Google Chrome launch was speeded up twice!

The update is free if you are a customer. Note that run on others *ARM* devices like *ODROID*.
