# CROZONO: Pentesting with Drones

![drones](/images/2015/11/drones.png)

Two passions joined in this exciting project to boards like the _Pi_. Thanks to [jsitech.com](https://www.jsitech.com/seguridad/crozono-un-framework-para-pentesting-con-drones/) (spanish link), I met **CROZONO** developed by _Sheila Berta_ and _Paul Romans_.

It is an open source framework for pentesting with drones or robots. You know, attacks wireless networks and if there is vulnerability, send the data to access the network to you. In the above link you have all the details in Spanish and now I leave you with the project on Github.
