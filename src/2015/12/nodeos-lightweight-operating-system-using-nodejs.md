# NodeOS: Lightweight operating system using Node.js

![NodeOS](/images/2015/11/nodeos.png)

The magic of *JavaScript* is beyond the boundaries of your browser. We can see it as the main programming languages on Arduino or similar, mobile applications frameworks or servers with *Node.js* among others.

**NodeOS** it is an operating system based on the package system *npm*. It is built on the top of a Linux architecture and you can download images containers [here](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/releases). It can run on desktops, servers or development boards like *Raspberry Pi or ODROID*.

I think it is a project that we should not lose track. Moreover, is developed by Spanish guys and is a product in constant evolution.
