# NodeOS: Lightweight operating system using Node.js

![NodeOS](/images/2015/11/nodeos.png)

The magic of _JavaScript_ is beyond the boundaries of your browser. We can see it as the main programming languages on Arduino or similar, mobile applications frameworks or servers with _Node.js_ among others.

**NodeOS** it is an operating system based on the package system _npm_. It is built on the top of a Linux architecture and you can download images containers [here](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/releases). It can run on desktops, servers or development boards like _Raspberry Pi or ODROID_.

I think it is a project that we should not lose track. Moreover, is developed by Spanish guys and is a product in constant evolution.
