# Updated distros for Raspberry Pi 2 and those to coming soon

![boxes](/images/2015/02/boxes.jpg)

It's appearing the revisions of operating systems to accommodate the new *SoC* on the *Pi2*. Let's see those already updated and those to come in the following article.

Updated distros:

![4 cores](/images/2015/02/4cores.jpg)

* [Raspbian y NOOBS](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/): It was hoped that the official release is already adapted to change. What I liked most is the boot start with the 4 raspberries symbolizing the 4 cores of the new processor.

* [Debbian Jessie](http://sjoerd.luon.net/posts/2015/02/debian-jessie-on-rpi2/): One thing I need is to change from *Wheezy to Jessie* on *Debian* based distros to get the latest packages. Well, we already have a version to test with *Kernel 3.18 + firmware* occupying 3 GB.

* [Snappy Ubuntu Core](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/): Honestly what I have more desire to try as soon as I get the *Pi2* is to test this minimalist distribution has also revolutionized the net these days. More info on [Ubuntu](http://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/) website.

* [OpenELEC](http://openelec.tv/news/22-releases/154-openelec-5-0-1-released): Our favorite distribution for leisure and entertainment has been updated updating to the  kernel 3.18 and it works really well as you can see in the video that accompanies the article.

* [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/2015/02/raspberry-pi-2-released-with-osmc-support/): Formerly known as *Raspbmc* is another distribution to run *XBMC* based on *Raspbian* but still is not very optimized in its Alpha 4 release.

* [Lakka](http://sources.lakka.tv/nightly/RPi2.arm/): The guys of this distribution based on *OpenELEC* to play emulators with *RetroArch* are looking for *Beta testers* on *Twitter*. For now and although it is not yet official, [here](http://sources.lakka.tv/nightly/RPi2.arm/) you have daily builds for *Raspberry Pi 2*.

Available soon:

* [Retro Pie](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/): We can't wait the new version adapted to the *Pi2*, although emulators in general [are not ready](https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup/issues/628) to use multiple cores, so do not expect to see much better performance.

* Android?: See this post from [linux.com](http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/807087-faster-raspberry-pi-2-says-yes-to-ubuntu-and-windows-but-wheres-android).

* Others: For other distributions that we use as *Arch Linux, Pidora or Risc OS* we also have to wait a few days or even weeks, but it will come.

* Windows 10: It will take to arrive and not be a *Windows* to use as all imagine, but it sure we can use it for the IOT.

While I wait *My Raspberry Pi 2* behind the door. Mr. Postman, if you're reading this, I promise you a beer if you are not late.
