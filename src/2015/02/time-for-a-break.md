# Time for a break

First of all, thank you for the words in the comments of the [previous post](/post.php?id=518). Medical specialist found something wrong and they have to operate the next Monday to my wife, so I'll be offline for another week, but Iâ€™ll try to publish my summary of news like every Friday. Thank you and apologize.

I've published an article about tools about make 2D videogames (in spanish), if you are interested or want to translate, you can find it [here](/post.php?id=519&lang=es).
