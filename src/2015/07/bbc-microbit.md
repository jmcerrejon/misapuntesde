# BBC Micro:bit

![microbit_min.jpg](/images/2015/07/microbit_min.jpg)

Yesterday came out in almost every digital media and we continue receiving news about this new board have been made from the _BBC_ quarters in collaboration with 29 companies, of which highlights some as _ARM, Barclays, element14, Freescale, Lancaster University, Microsoft, Nordic Semiconductor, Samsung and the Wellcome Trust_.

What it gives this board that is interesting?. I'll tell you after the jump...

The first is that sixth graders pupils from _UK_ will receive one of it **free of charge** (This means about **one million boards**).

Let's check out some features:

-   Size: 4x5 cms

-   ARM Cortex M-O processor

-   5x5 LEDs matrix

-   2 programmable buttons

-   1 accelerometer

-   1 compass

-   Bluetooth LE

-   5 I/O rings

-   1 USB

This board alone does not make much sense to us and is more like an _Arduino_ that other board, but imagine what you can do together with the _Raspberry Pi_.

It will be available in October and I have not read anything that is to be put up for sale, although being _Open Source_ development, any company will.
