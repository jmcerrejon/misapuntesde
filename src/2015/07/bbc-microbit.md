# BBC Micro:bit

![microbit_min.jpg](/images/2015/07/microbit_min.jpg)

Yesterday came out in almost every digital media and we continue receiving news about this new board have been made from the *BBC* quarters in collaboration with 29 companies, of which highlights some as *ARM, Barclays, element14, Freescale, Lancaster University, Microsoft, Nordic Semiconductor, Samsung and the Wellcome Trust*.

What it gives this board that is interesting?. I'll tell you after the jump...

The first is that sixth graders pupils from *UK* will receive one of it **free of charge** (This means about **one million boards**).

Let's check out some features:

* Size: 4x5 cms

* ARM Cortex M-O processor

* 5x5 LEDs matrix

* 2 programmable buttons

* 1 accelerometer

* 1 compass

* Bluetooth LE

* 5 I/O rings

* 1 USB

This board alone does not make much sense to us and is more like an *Arduino* that other board, but imagine what you can do together with the *Raspberry Pi*.

It will be available in October and I have not read anything that is to be put up for sale, although being *Open Source* development, any company will.
