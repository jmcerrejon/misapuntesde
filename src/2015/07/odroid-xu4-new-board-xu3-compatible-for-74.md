# ODROID-XU4, new board XU3 compatible for $74

It seems that there is no summer for *Hardkernel* guys. While the *ODROID-C1* stock is sold, new PCB come to scene. I present you the brand new **ODROID-XU4**.

I hightligh the next features:


* Size: 82 x 58 x 22 mm approx. Weight, 60 gr with fan

* Samsung Exynos 5422 octa-core with 4 Cortex-A15 CPU cores and 4 ARM Cortex-A7 cores

* 2GB of RAM, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet

* Mali-T628 MP6 OpenGL ES 3.0 / 2.0 / 1.1 and OpenCL 1.1 Full profile

* 2 USB 3.0 + 1 USB 2.0 port

* No Jack or DisplayPort

* Support Android 4.4 & 5.0, Ubuntu 15.04 and all OS for XU3

* Power supply 5V-4A

The price included built-in fan and power supply. If you go to the product page, the numerous *benchmarks* speak for itself. I would emphasize speed of *eMMC 5.0* and is an ideal for *NAS* or use it as Desktop PC, due to their high rates of transfer. The downside comes with the international shipping cost, amounting to $25, so at the end you pay for the board $100 dollars (about 90 euros).

Still, I think it is a very full board and in the context of price where it moves is hardly be beaten.
