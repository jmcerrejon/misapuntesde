# ODROID-C1+ next week

![ODROID-C1_plus.jpg](/images/2015/07/ODROID-C1_plus.jpg)

I received a tip last minute (I can not reveal the source): **We'll have ODROID-C1+ next week**. This is what I know about the changes that it have with respect to the first version...

* Change the HDMI connector to Type-A from Type-D.

* Improved SD card compatibility

* CEC function without RTC backup battery

* Power path from USB OTG port as well as DC-Jack

* Expose I2S signals for external audio DAC

* Price: $37 (34 Euros)

Actually I consider the *ODROID-C1* has a great value for money. **Soon I will have the ODROID-XU4** in my hands, so I'll do the corresponding unboxing and will take several benchmarks.
