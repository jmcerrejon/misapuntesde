# Banana Pi CookBook

![Banana Pi cover](/images/2015/06/bananapi_cover.jpg)

Has recently go on sale this book that collects **25 interesting recipes for Banana Pi**.

I've participated in the elaboration of each chapter of this book, and I can assure you that it a **MUST HAVE** If you have one of these boards.

After the jump, I tell you what it's about.

What You Will Learn:

* Discover how to configure and maintain your Banana Pi device

* Install Android and a Linux-based distribution onto the Banana Pi

* Attach external drives to your Banana Pi by using the USB or SATA interfaces

* Install and configure common server applications and multimedia applications on Linux

* Share files between your Banana Pi and other devices either in your internal network or over the Internet

* Set up a secure web stack and run blogging software on your device

* Connect remotely to your Banana Pi using SSH and VNC

* Build simple electrical circuits and connect simple hardware elements such as LEDs, resistors, buttons to the GPIO pins

* Configure a multimedia centre that is able to play high definition content

Its author is called *Ryad El-Dajani* and I think that is among the first to achieve great progress when set within the major operating systems available, features such as graphics acceleration, *XBMC* or create one of the best *Arch Linux* distributions on this board.

From here I wish luck to the author, it has been a pleasure working with you.
