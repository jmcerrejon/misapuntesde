# rpix86 version 0.19 released!

![rpix86](/images/rpix86_logo.jpg)

I had one of those productive morning looking for new ideas for the blog, which I will explain soon, and I have also gathered a lot of information for future post.

Today I want to comment the changes on a new version of this emulator for *MS-DOS* to the *Raspberry Pi.*

- - -
This version contains the following fixes and improvements:

* Implemented missing FPU opcodes (TradeWars 2002).

* Implemented JPE/JPO opcode hacks for TradeWars 2002.

* Fixed DMA current register off-by-1 problem (Tyrian 2000).
