# rpix86 0.18 released!

![rpix86](/images/rpix86_logo.jpg)

Yesterday my friend _Patrick_ release after a pause in their duties with the Pi, the new version of the best **MS-DOS emulator for Raspberry Pi, rpix86**. Let's see the improvements...

---

-   Implemented support for FPU opcodes in Real Mode (Trade Wars 2002).

-   Implemented support for Borland RTM DOS Extender (Jazz Jackrabbit, Tyrian 2000).

-   Added a new command line switch -noems to disable EMS (Ultima VII).

-   Changed the GPIO RS-232 port handling to emulate a null modem cable connection.
