# Raspberry Pi and the IoT

![PiOT](/images/2015/06/piot_logo_v2.png)

This weekend surfing the web, I found a very interesting guide about the *Pi and the IoT (Internet of Things)*, where you will learn among other things...

- - -
* Learn the fundamentals of using a Raspberry Pi (booting up your Pi, using the Linux command prompt, remotely logging into your Pi, etc.)

* Wire up simple circuits using a breadboard (no previous experience required)

* Write and run simple Python scripts that will run on a Pi (no previous experience required)

* Build multiple live Internet of Things projects that stream data to a cloud service
