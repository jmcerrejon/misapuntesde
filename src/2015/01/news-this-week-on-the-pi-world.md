# News this week on the Pi World

First, let me apologize for the fall he suffered on Wednesday due web hosting problems. It took about 8 hours to be solved.

I wanted to remind you that have collected on the right side bar, Google Docs about boards that I acquired and surely will be of particular interest for you.

This week we talk about ghosts, comparisons and VoIP.

By the way, I want to thank you again for the great reception that still has the tutorial about [Retro Arch in OpenELEC](/post.php?id=502) and comments. Doubts in the post, I will try to resolve gradually.
