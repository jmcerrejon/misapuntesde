# Mis apuntes de... responsive

![misa responsive](/images/2015/01/misa_responsive.jpg)

Well, after two years, it was time to do the blog responsive or adaptive to different screen sizes, so it will be more confortable for blog visitors navigate it with your tablet or mobile.

It's something that was pending for a long and planned to do a complete change regarding *Back and Front-End*, but better go step by step and change things slowly (I remember to you that this blog is programmed from scratch, no *WordPress* or similar *CMS*). For the *Front-End* I chose on [purecss](http://purecss.io/), but since I'm not an expert in design I decided to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) due its simplicity and the help you can find on the internet  about this cool framework.

However, I will continue making changes. If you notice something weird, let me know please.

You can post a comment if you like the change.

Thank You!
