**Gideros Studio** is a *Lua-based*, cross platform game engine allowing easy creation of apps and currently supporting *iOS and Android* targets. Launched in 2011, *Gideros* has become one of the most successful game engines with **20,000 developers registered and 500 games published**...

This weekend, the campaign started in *Kickstarter* by *John Blackburn* has been funded. Their goal was to raise funds for it to be ported to systems such as *OSX, Windows (Desktop and Phone)* and between platforms that have chosen was the **Raspberry Pi**.

He has a lot of work now. Hopefully see their progress soon.
