![raylib](/images/2015/01/raylib_logo.png)

If you've ever programmed or know *SDL, Allegro* libraries, or any kind of *framework*, you may have noticed all the save time by yourself to implement certain system calls or the language you want to use.

[raylib](http://www.raylib.com/) is a small open source library under the license [zlib/libpng](http://www.raylib.com/license.htm) in C very interesting with simple examples so you can create multiplatform games or multimedia applications. Also supports *Android, HTML5* and of course **Raspberry Pi**.

- - -

* Uses C# PascalCase/camelCase notation

* Hardware accelerated with OpenGL (1.1, 3.3+ or ES2)

* Unique OpenGL abstraction layer [rlgl]

* Powerful fonts module with SpriteFonts support

* Multiple textures support, including DDS and mipmaps generation

* Basic 3d support for Geometrics, Models, Heightmaps and Billboards

* Powerful math module for Vector and Matrix operations [raymath]

* Audio loading and playing with streaming support (WAV and OGG)

The **current version is 1.2.2** and you have an installer for *Windows* or you can easily compile with instructions that you can follow on *Github*.
