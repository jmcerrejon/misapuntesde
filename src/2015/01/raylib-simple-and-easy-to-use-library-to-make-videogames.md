If you've ever programmed or know _SDL, Allegro_ libraries, or any kind of _framework_, you may have noticed all the save time by yourself to implement certain system calls or the language you want to use.

[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is a small open source library under the license [zlib/libpng](https://www.raylib.com/license.htm) in C very interesting with simple examples so you can create multiplatform games or multimedia applications. Also supports _Android, HTML5_ and of course **Raspberry Pi**.

---

-   Uses C# PascalCase/camelCase notation

-   Hardware accelerated with OpenGL (1.1, 3.3+ or ES2)

-   Unique OpenGL abstraction layer [rlgl]

-   Powerful fonts module with SpriteFonts support

-   Multiple textures support, including DDS and mipmaps generation

-   Basic 3d support for Geometrics, Models, Heightmaps and Billboards

-   Powerful math module for Vector and Matrix operations [raymath]

-   Audio loading and playing with streaming support (WAV and OGG)

The **current version is 1.2.2** and you have an installer for _Windows_ or you can easily compile with instructions that you can follow on _Github_.
