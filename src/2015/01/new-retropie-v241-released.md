# New RetroPie V2.4.1 released

![RetroPie](/images/RetroPie_02.jpg)

**UPDATED POST**

Long ago we had no news from _Petrockblock_ and this time presents a new version in beta state of the distro for retro-players like me. This time we have a stripped down version of _Raspbian_ (from 1.2 GB to 610 MB) which has eliminated much of the preinstalled software. Let's see some new features...

---

-   Minor bug fixes

-   Updated RetroPie-Setup Script

-   Update of all components, e.g., RetroArch supports ZIP files natively now

-   Dispmanx can be activated or deactivated for each emulator individually now

-   The screen mode is configurable for each emulator individually now

-   Added Atari Lynx emulator

-   Added Darkplaces Quake (experimental)

-   Added Minecraft-Pi (experimental)

-   Added OpenMSX (experimental)

-   Enhanced integration of ScummVM

-   Stripped down number of installed system packages to a minimum

-   Reorganization of the binaries

### [ Comments about this version ]

The first is that the _Raspbian_ version is more optimized for games. Very fast startup and the detection of the _XBOX360_ Control Pad has done with no problem.

We see few options on the menu:

-   PORTS: Doom, Duke Nukem and Quaque 3 (all shareware, but work without having to get the .wad)

-   Macintosh: It has not worked for me, you may need the ROM or BIOS to work.

-   IBM: DosBox (I would have preferred rpix86). To exit, type EXIT and press ENTER.

-   Apple II: black screen and you need to restart RetroPie.

-   ScummVM (see 1.7.0, 3 January, 2015): Perfect.

Remember that for other emulators, we need to add through _SAMBA_ some _ROMs_. I tried several and all work perfectly and all the emulators recognized the joypad. To exit of each emulator, you must press the key combination **SELECT+START**.

What I liked is the resolution changes in each emulator to fit your screen perfectly.

Overall it is progressing rapidly and I think will become in the favorite system of many gamers.
