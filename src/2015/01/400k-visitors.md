# 400k visitors!

![Thank you](/images/thank.jpg)

Today I'm celebrating ... **This blog has reached 400,000 visitors!**

The words of thanks go to my family that supports me even now labor uncertainty will gradually overcoming, and to you for reading and sharing everything I write here.

My goals for this year is to give a facelift to the blog, and introduce more content related to other boards, without neglecting our beloved Pi.

We continue to read, and hopefully for many years!
