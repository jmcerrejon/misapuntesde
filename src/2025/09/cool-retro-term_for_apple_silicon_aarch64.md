# Cool-Retro-Term recompiled for Apple Silicon aarch64 (download link)

If you're a few years old like me, I think you'll be a lover of the aesthetics of old CRT terminals as a good retro lover that we are. `Cool-Retro-Term` emulates it very well and I'm sure you already know it.

`brew` on _macOS_ installs it without problems, but only for Intel _x86_64_ using _Rosetta 2_, which adds an emulation layer that can affect performance. I've tried it and it's not that noticeable, but if you have an _Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)_ computer and you want to get the most out of it, the ideal is to have a native version for _aarch64_, don't you think?

Well, today I have compiled it for _aarch64_ and I leave it here in case you are interested. I have refactored some warnings that came out when compiling, but in general everything works perfectly following the steps that you can read in the _GitHub_ repository [here](<https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term/wiki/Build-Instructions-(macOS)>). I hope you enjoy it and let me know if you find any bugs.
