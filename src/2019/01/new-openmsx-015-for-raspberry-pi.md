# New OpenMSX 0.15 for Raspberry Pi!

![OpenMSX 0.15](/images/2019/01/openmsx_015.jpg "OpenMSX 0.15")

The best *MSX* emulator is already here loaded with new features! If you're a fan of this emulator or the *MSX* of the last century, come in and I've prepared a *.deb* package for you to enjoy along with the recommendation of a game to have fun.

###  [ Changelog ]

I've compiled it for *Raspbian Stretch*. You have the news [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMSX/openMSX/RELEASE_0_15_0/doc/release-notes.txt). I'll summarize some of them for you:

* Support for ColecoVision, Musical Memory Mapper and Carnivore 2

* Fixed 16 year old bug regarding sprites behaviour

* Performance improvements: several fixes to improve start-up time

* Fixed crash in hq/hqlite scalers in interlace modes

* Upgraded C-BIOS to release 0.29a

###  [ Install ]

The *.deb* file is available at the end of the article for *Raspbian*. To install it, download and execute the following:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i openmsx_0.15.0_armhf.deb
```

If you want to extend the information a little more and that the emulator has a better performance, you can follow the article I published long time ago about the previous version of the emulator [here](/post.php?id=843).

###  [ Extra ]

I let you with the link to a website where games are collected from many 8-bit computers. The recommendation this time is *Phantomas saga infinity* that does not need presentation, and if you do not know it, you are already taking time to visit the web.
