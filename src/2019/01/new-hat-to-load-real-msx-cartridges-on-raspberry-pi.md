# New HAT to load REAL MSX cartridges on Raspberry Pi

![msx_cartridge](/images/2019/01/msx_cartridge.jpg)

You know I'm a fan of retro computers. I had a *ZX Spectrum*, but also spent my childhood with a *MSX*. With this computer you could load games through *cassettes, floppy disks and cartridges*. Imagine being able to use a *Raspberry PI* not only for *SD* card programs, but also for **real MSX cartridges**. *Victor Trucco* ([@victortrucco](https://twitter.com/victortrucco)) has put this into practice. Do you want to know more?...

The project is in an early stage, but games of the first *MSX* generation run without other big problems. *BlueberryMSX*, a ported *BlueMSX* by known *MRC* member *uberjack* supports the new extension so far, we hope for soon integration of [openMSX](/post.php?id=843).

The board is based on the *GPIO* of the *RasPi*. The cost for a single interface is **45 Euros** (A little more if you are based on *Europe*).
