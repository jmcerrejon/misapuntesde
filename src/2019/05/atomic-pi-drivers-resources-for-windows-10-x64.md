# Atomic Pi: drivers & resources for Windows 10 x64

![AtomicPi](/images/2019/05/atomic_pi.jpg)

As I said, my enthusiasm for an *Atomic Pi* was to be able to play old classics games from 1999-2010. I have them on a hard drive and also in my memory. When people want to play *Red Dead 2 or Fortnite*, I prefer *Unreal, Quake or Serious Sam*.

Many have asked me about drivers, as they seem to be giving problems to find the right ones. I'm going to leave you in a personal *Dropbox* folder that I've shared, **all the drivers** you're going to need for your *APi*. I made the copy with a software called [DriverBackup!](https://sourceforge.net/projects/drvback/) and it comes with an executable that allows you to install all the drivers updated. Not one of the devices of the board will escape, hehe.

I'm also leaving other programs and doc I consider useful, for example all the  *Visual C++* libraries in an official installer or the famous *DirectX 9* that can coexist perfectly with those that already brings *Windows 10*.

This week I will try to upload a video to [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXhElW3ALmWjH_uRqVR-KRFn2WEprno4G) with the games I have tested. It's all good news, don't you think? I hope that soon you will get yours and any doubt, ask me.
