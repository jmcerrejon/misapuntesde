# News this week in the Pi World!

![cooling_pi](/images/2019/07/coolin_pi4.png)

We quickly moved on to the important thing cause I'm going on vacation and brought this post forward by one day. The Pi4 warms up in summer, and we all make an effort to keep it cool. In the meantime, new OS compatible with the new Pi and something about the Atomic Pi will also be seen in this **Pi World** summary. Let's get started!

-   **The Raspberry Pi 4 needs a fan, here's why and how you can add one:** Pi gets hot, and we're not just talking about _CPU_. It's the complete board, so we're going to have to get a fan and connect it to the _GPIO_ port and lower the temperature by about 20 degrees using the official case. Thanks Jeff. | [jeffgeerling.com](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/raspberry-pi-4-needs-fan-heres-why-and-how-you-can-add-one)

-   **Using the Atomic Pi as a workbench computer:** The _Atomic Pi_ has become my _Raspberry Pi 4_. This article details how to create a case, add a _USB_ port, _SSD_ and _Arduino Nano_. It doesn't seem complicated at all, really. | [hydrogen18.com](https://www.hydrogen18.com/blog/using-the-atomic-pi-as-a-workbench-computer.html)

-   **Raspberry Pi 4 iUniker Low Profile Heatsink/Fan Test - Review (Youtube):** Not a week goes by in which some Youtuber does not test a cooler system for the Pi 4. The video of the week is dedicated to that but I could not stop commenting on the test offered by the channel _ETA PRIME_. | [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wwk4HR9G51Y)

-   **Raspberry Pi 4 case (40mm fan) by John_Sinclair:** I recommend a case for the Pi4 in case you want to incorporate a fan, which with these heat will be needed, unless you live in a _Bat Cave_ like me. | [thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723481)
