# Play Diablo 1 on Raspberry Pi 4

![Diablo 1](/images/2019/10/diablo1.jpg)

All the glory goes to the person who's bringing this *Blizzard* game to other platforms. His *Github's* account is [diasurgical](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/). Now **you can enjoy the game on your Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 natively**.

For those who don't know, *Diablo* is a mix of action and *RPG* that invites us to travel to hell to see our faces with his master and lord. It was released in 1997 for PC and is one of those games that marked a before and after in the video game industry.

It's not yet possible to have it translated into languages other than *English*, but some people are working on it.

You can download the script to install it, as always, from my project [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS).

Enjoy!
