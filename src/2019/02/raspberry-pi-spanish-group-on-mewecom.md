# Raspberry Pi spanish group on mewe.com

![Rpi3bp](/images/2018/03/rpi3bp.png)

The end of **Google+** has motivated other companies to create the perfect and  it seems that there is a lot of people talking about a new social network (Another more?!) called [mewe](https://mewe.com/). Something has called me to create there the **first group in Spanish to talk about the Raspberry Pi**, so it will serve as a meeting point for Spanish speakers, we will have the opportunity to chat or be aware of news in a more direct way. I have left the channel open so that you can also add links and keep a community alive to be informed.

You have another [german](https://mewe.com/join/raspberry_pi) interesting groups. I let you with the links below. What are you waiting for?
