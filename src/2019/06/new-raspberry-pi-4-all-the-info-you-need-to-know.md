* *USB* ports: *2×USB 3.0, 2×USB 2.0*. 

* Video and sound output: **2×micro HDMI ports (4Kp60)**, 2-lane MIPI DSI display port, 2-lane MIPI CSI camera, 4-pole port stereo audio and composite video. 

* Multimedia: **H.265 (4Kp60 decode)**, *H.264 (1080p60 decode, 1080p30 encode); OpenGL Graphics ES 3.0*. 

* Temperature: 0-50ºC.

* Power supply: *5V DC recommended 3A USB-C or GPIO header*, *Power over Ethernet* (PoE)-enabled. 

###  [ First comments ]

The first opinions were not long in coming. On the price, as always very well. The *basic* version with 1 Gb is kept at $35. The community disagree on change  connector for hdmi video output, which is different now. Good choice the  *Cortex-A72* processor. Of course, people are dreaming about the performance for *N64 emulation or Windows*, xD. LibreELEC has a new release with initial support, *9.2 Alpha 1*. What do you think? I read you in the comments.
