# Where am I? In MeWe!

![mewe](/images/2019/03/mewe_logo.png)

I haven't updated the blog in a while. I'm not going to apologize, you know how it is. I haven't been bored, but my Pi has gone into the background and I need time for other stuff... **but** opened a channel on the new social network **MeWe** called *Raspberry Pi en Espa&ntilde;ol* and I intend to continue writting from there along with whoever wants, news about our beloved Pi.

*MeWe* is a social network created in 2016 that has some of the most used features of other social networks and aims to replace *Google+* but with the difference that this network presents itself as the *"Private Social Network"* so there are no advertising banners or tracking users.

What I like most is that it is dynamic, a chat room for chatting with other fans, curious and restless minds like me, and still not overcrowded. So there I wait for you if you are Spanish speakers. We are already **almost 300 members**. You have others communities in english. I recommend you [mewe > raspberrypiforever](https://mewe.com/join/raspberrypiforever).

Anyway, this is not the end of the blog, it's a to be continue...
