# Relational Database Vs NoSQL

![rdbms versus nosql](/images/2024/07/rdbms_vs_nosql.jpg "It's funny the image generated by the AI, the young guy for NoSQL")

As a developer, you will most likely have done a project, and had to use a relational database. It happens all the time on each project. I think I miss very few relational *DBMS* (Database Management System) that I havenâ€™t used in my profile as *DevOp*. This has not been the case for non-relational *BBDD* or also called *NoSQL* (*Not Only SQL*) such as *MongoDB*. I will explain the differences above and in a future article, we will see their use.

## Relational Databases

### Main Features

1. **Tabular structure**: The data is organized in tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column an attribute of the record.
2. **Fixed Schema**: Require a predefined schema that determines the structure of data before it can be stored.
3. **SQL language**: Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and query.
4. **ACID properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability, which ensures reliable and consistent transactions.

### Pros

- **Consistency and Security**: Ideal for applications that require secure and consistent transactions, such as financial systems.
- **Data Integrity**: Thanks to the *ACID* properties, the integrity and consistency of the data is ensured.
- **Tools and Support**: Wide availability of tools and support due to its long history in the market.

### Cons

- **Vertical Scalability**: Generally they scale better vertically (increasing server capacity) than horizontally (adding more servers).
- **Scheme Rigidity**: Less flexible to changes in data structure, which may make it difficult to adapt to new needs.

### Examples and where you could use it

Relational databases are often used in **applications that require primarily transactional systems**, where data consistency and integrity are critical and the data have a fixed, well-defined structure. Examples: *MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server*. You can use them in banking systems, inventory management, reservation system, CRM,...

::: warning Pro Tip
Do you have to do a lot of JOIN information?. Then opt for using *SGBD* relational.

## NoSQL Databases

### Main Features

1. **Dynamic Schema**: Do not require a fixed schema, allowing for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.
2. **Various Data Models**: They include several types such as key-value, documents, columns and graphs.
3. **Scale Out**: Designed to scale easily by adding more nodes to the system.
4. **Eventual consistency**: Often prioritise availability and partitioning tolerance over immediate consistency, following the [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem).

### Pros

- **Flexibility**: Can handle data of different types and structures without the need for a predefined schema.
- **Scalability**: Scale horizontally efficiently, ideal for applications with high data volumes and high availability needs.
- **Performance**: They offer high performance in read and write operations.

### Cons

- **Less Consistency**: In many cases they offer instant rather than instant consistency, which may not be suitable for all applications.
- **Less Support Tools**: Although this is changing, they have historically had fewer tools and support compared to relational databases.

### Examples and where you could use it

They are perfect for **Big Data and real-time analytics** as they support fast access to large volumes of data and the data does not necessarily have to be fixed in structure. Examples: *MongoDB (documents), Cassandra (columns or tabular), Redis or Amazon DynamoDB (key-value)*. The most common use of this type of database is for location, geospatial/streaming/messaging/transaction/inventory data, customer profile, vector embeddings,...

## When to choose one or the other?

Obviously, it will be defined by the project you must accomplish. There are no winners or victors, and each one is born with a purpose. I have given you some examples and use cases, but experience will show you which is the most suitable. If you have any questions, you can [contact me](mailto:ulysess@gmail.com) and I will help you choose which database to use, but if we have to order food, then you choose. ðŸ˜†
