# SOLID principles PHP Edition. Today: Liskov Substitution Principle

![Liskov Substitution Principle](/images/2024/04/liskov.jpg "Liskov Substitution Principle. Generated with AI.")

In the noble art of coding, you should remember the **SOLID principles** always. Sometimes, I forget some of then, so here is a brief explanation of each principle:

* _[Single Responsibility Principle](https://misapuntesde.com/2024/03/solid_principles_php_edition_single_responsibility_principle.html)_: A class should have only one reason to change.
* _[Open/Closed Principle](https://misapuntesde.com/2024/03/solid_principles_php_edition_open_closed_principle.html)_: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* _Liskov Substitution Principle_: You should be able to use any subclass in place of its parent class.
* _Interface Segregation Principle_: A class should not be forced to implement an interface it doesn't use.
* _Dependency Inversion Principle_: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Today we are going to focus on the **Liskov Substitution Principle**.

Here you have an example on _PHP_ about it:
