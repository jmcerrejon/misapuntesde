# You Were Waiting for It: PHP Vs Python

![Pythons Versus Elephants](/images/2024/10/python_vs_php.jpg "Generated by Copilot")

I hate technical interviews like everyone else. But there is **SOMETHING** I like about them: **the questions I haven't previously asked myself**. Usually, there's no time to develop an answer that one likes, you know how perfectionist I am. One of them was this week:

_"What advantages do you see in Python over PHP?"_.

I found it interesting and decided to write an article about it from a broad and not very technical perspective.

---

**PHP** and **Python**. Both are high-level languages and for me, they have no rivals when it comes to creating web applications. Okay, _JavaScript_ is also very good, but it's thanks to its frameworks (_React, Angular, Vue, Express_), don't deny it. üò¨

I started with _PHP_ making websites, and I have more than 15 years of experience with it. Although I still follow the scene of the latter, I have switched sides, and _Python_ has been my favorite language for 3-4 years. I don't regret it, and it's not because of _AI_ or _Machine Learning_, which also, but because of its clear and readable syntax, its versatility, and the community that supports it. But let's not get ahead of ourselves...

## The Best of PHP

_PHP_ has long been the king of web development, thanks in recent years to _WordPress or frameworks like Laravel_ ‚ô•Ô∏è. It was designed from the beginning for creating dynamic websites as a scripting language, making it a language specifically oriented to web environments. The features that some of us, not just me, find more interesting are:

-   **Specialization in Web Development**: With functions and features optimized for creating dynamic content along with HTML through tags, forms, or a very simple way to manage sessions on the server.

-   **Ease of Integration and Libraries**: Where can't you run a _PHP_ server today?. Any _hosting_ is natively supported by all major hosting providers. Let's not forget that unrivaled tools like `composer` allow us to use libraries for any functionality we need. And the best part, almost always updated, something that can't be said for others like in the _React_ world (Ahem!).

-   **Large Community and Ecosystem Maturity**: The _PHP_ developer community is very extensive and today, experienced. **A LOT**. Any problem you face has already been solved in some forum, blog, or _YouTube_ video. For me, it's an important point because when I faced _Rust_ I felt alone in the world, especially because of its somewhat toxic community, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. I ended up abandoning it.

-   **Cost-effectiveness**: Well, it might be because I know a PHP framework (Laravel again! üòç) better than myself. This has allowed me to quickly launch an _MVP_. What would the world be without _WordPress_?. Although I hate it, for small or medium projects, _PHP_ is an option I find very attractive. And it has fed many who call themselves developers, poor things.

I would comment on some technical advantages like execution speed, `Namespaces`, the fantastic `PDO` Class, or the great support for multiple architecture styles, but I don't want to extend too much and I think I'll leave it for a second more technical article.

## The Best of Python

_Python_, created in the early 90s, has gained great popularity in the last decade due to its simplicity, the scientific community, _Machine Learning_, and okay, _Artificial Intelligence_, I said it.

Its versatility and an approach that favors code readability have made it popular in the scientific community, mathematicians, and it has infected a large part of developers worldwide.

Unlike _PHP_, _Python_ was not designed exclusively for the web, and this for me is one of its strengths, since before as developers, we had to create mostly websites (today it's a somewhat saturated market)... _Bored! Not anymore_.

Let's go with its strengths:

-   **Clear and Readable Syntax:** Which prioritizes code readability and greatly facilitates collaboration between developers and code maintainability, especially over time. One of _Python_'s principles is: _"There should be one‚Äîand preferably only one‚Äîobvious way to do it"_.

*   **Versatility Beyond the Web:** As I mentioned, _Python_ is a multipurpose language. Besides the mentioned uses, it is useful for task automation, data analysis, _GUI/TUI_ tools, even game development. This makes it an ideal language for developers who want to work in multiple disciplines. Versatility was one of the reasons I chose _JavaScript_ back in the day, as it allowed me to even make mobile apps for almost a decade.

*   **Powerful Frameworks for Development and Libraries:** _Python_ has powerful and modern web frameworks like **Django**, **Flask**, or the New Kid on the Block, **FastAPI**. They allow developing scalable, secure, and efficient applications in a short time. Python **is the dominant language in the field of data analysis**, thanks to the vast number of scientific libraries and tools for anything you can think of. **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow** come to mind. It is currently the best option for companies that require data processing or artificial intelligence capabilities in their applications, whatever they may be.

Again, as technical features, I would comment on the simplicity of object-oriented programming, the implementation of `@decorators`, or the ease of integration with other languages like _C or Rust_.

## PHP Beats Python

Despite the growing interest in _Python_, sorry but _PHP_ remains a solid choice in many circumstances:

-   **Performance in Web Applications:** For standard web applications that require handling large volumes of _HTTP_ requests without complex processing logic. _PHP_ is extremely efficient and can handle multiple simultaneous requests without additional infrastructure, making it a solid choice for high-traffic applications. I affirm it, _PHP_ is faster than _Python_ in web applications. I'll prove it another day.

-   **Affordable Hosting and Third-party Server Support:** _PHP_ is natively supported by most web servers, simplifying its configuration and deployment. Additionally, shared web hosting plans are significantly cheaper for _PHP_ applications, reducing the total development cost, especially compared to hosting options for _Python_ applications, which I haven't looked for much, to be honest. I've always deployed on virtual machines or dedicated servers.

-   **Ease of Use with Popular CMS:** As I mentioned, many popular content management systems (_CMS_) are based on _PHP_. This makes it the default choice for projects that require integration with these _CMS_, or for sites that rely on existing plugins and/or themes.

-   **Greater Maturity in Backend Tools:** _PHP_ has a long history in backend development and has mature tools for creating _RESTful APIs_, authentication, and session control. These features have fed me for years, and I can't complain.

## Python Beats PHP

_Python_ has gained popularity by leaps and bounds in the last decade, and there are clear reasons why many developers and companies prefer _Python over PHP_:

-   **Code Readability, Debugging, and Maintainability:** Its clear and readable syntax makes development and debugging easier (much more at least than _PHP_ and _XDebug_, what a _PITA_). Code maintainability is crucial, and here _Python_ seems a bit cleaner to me. Code can quickly become chaotic in large projects if the language does not favor readability and organization. I can assure you. Yes, the architecture we use will define this, but the language also matters. Or not?.

-   **Versatility and High-level Applications:** _Python_ is a complete platform for multiple purposes: _Backend, Jupyter Notebook, data processing, AI_. Here it wins the battle against almost all existing languages.

-   **Rapid Development and Prototyping:** Especially with frameworks like _Django_. Its _"convention over configuration"_ approach reduces the time needed to establish a basic infrastructure. We only need to focus on business logic and functionalities.

-   **Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:** I couldn't help but mention that it is the chosen language for _AI and Machine Learning_ development. Many companies see it as the future of their businesses, thanks to its compatibility with cutting-edge tools, _SDKs_ ready for _Python_ by major companies offering _AI_, and the active community that supports these developments.

## Final Words

The battle between _PHP and Python_ has no clear winner, as it largely depends on the context and project needs.

Wait,... then I'll take a stand.

_PHP_ remains the preferred choice for traditional web development, especially when looking for low costs and easy integration with established _CMS_. _Python_, on the other hand, is the chosen language for projects that seek a focus on modern technologies like _AI_ and data science.

I didn't want to comment on the weaknesses of each, but I'll leave you with a couple of jokes that occurred to me while writing this article:

A _PHP_ colleague meets another from _Python_: _"How are you, P. GIL!. Look, go to human resources, they want to talk to you..."_

A _PHP_ lawyer in front of the judge: _"...And here is where I end my line of argument, your honor. Semicolon!"_

Both languages have a place in the modern development ecosystem, and each offers unique tools and resources that can be crucial for the success of a project, but I'm not going to be like others and say that both are equally good. No, they are not. **PYTHON IS BETTER**.
