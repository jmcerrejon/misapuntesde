# How I migrated from PHP to Vuepress 2

It's been 3 years since my last post here. I've been busy with my work and other projects. The new approach I want to give to the blog is going to be a bit different. Less _Raspberry Pi_ (I will tell you why) and focused in a more technical content. I will tell you about it in the next days.

Today I want to share with you how has been the experience of migrating a blog made in PHP + MySQL, to a static one using Vuepress 2.

## Now and then

This is not the first time I change the design. I don't remember when was the last time I did it, but it was a radical change (I have to look for a screenshot of the first version of the blog). The change I made back in the day was mainly to be responsive (gosh!, even the pages didn't need it that much these days!) and to be able to put some _Javascript_ plug-ins to zoom in the images and syntax highlighting in the source code I was displaying.

The technology in this aspect has not changed very much. We still rely on _Javascript_ on the client side and use it more than many _Javascript_ haters would like (_JQuery_ has gone into _Beta_ with version 4!).

(In development...)
