# Read Medium articles for free

![Alt](/images/2024/02/medium.png "Medium post read for free")

Just a quick tip If you want to read a _Medium_ article for free, cuz you don't have money to pay for a subscription or you don't want to create an account.

---

Just copy the URL of the article and paste before the link, the next:

```
https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:

# So the final URL will be something like this:

https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://medium.com/@josecerrejon/how-i-migrated-from-php-to-vuepress-2-part-ii-3b3e3e3e3e3e
```

I've tested and It doesn't works on _Safari_, but It does on _Brave_. I have to say that it does not always work, especially in cases where the article is very recent, but in most cases, It works.

Another solution is to use [removepaywall.com](https://www.removepaywall.com), as extension or web service.

Now you will be able to read it without any problem.

You're welcome! :smiley:
