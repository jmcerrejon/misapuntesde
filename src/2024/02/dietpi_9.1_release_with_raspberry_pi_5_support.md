_DietPi_, in its recent 9.1 release, introduces several exciting enhancements and bug fixes. Notably, it now provides support for the _Raspberry Pi 5_. Additionally, various `dietpi-software` options have been refined.

The new _Raspberry Pi 5_ images, based on the latest _Bookworm_ kernel and firmware package set from _Raspberry Pi Ltd_, are available for testing. However, some features—such as changing screen resolution and camera module support—are not yet functional. DietPi’s primary focus remains on performance and a compact installation size, with extensive configuration tools that allow for more customization than usual. If the performance gains, reduced _RAM_ usage, and faster boot times observed on the _Raspberry Pi 4_ persist, Die_tPi can provide a welcome boost to the _Raspberry Pi 5_ while also being energy-efficient.
