# Prompts for improving your texts using Artificial Intelligence

![I'm the good guy... for now](/images/2024/03/ai_writing.png "I'm the good guy... for now. Generated with AI.")

All prompts are extracted from the app [Fixkey](https://fixkey.app/). It's an app that uses AI to help you write better. It provides prompts to improve your writing, fix grammar,... Available for _macOS_, I use it a lot, but It's a trial version, and unfortunately, I don't have the money to subscribe to the app right now. If you can afford it, I recommend it.

If you go to the settings, you can check the prompts used by the app. I think these prompts are very interesting for any project. Even I am looking to make a similar app using _Python_. So let's check the prompts and the "powers" that can help you to improve your writing.

## Fix grammar

> Revise the given text to correct any grammatical errors. Focus on improving sentence structure, punctuation, verb tense consistency, and word usage. Ensure the text adheres to standard grammar rules of the language this text is written in, enhancing readability and clarity. When the sentence has a bullet point at the beginning, don't remove the bullet point, otherwise answer with raw text. If the input text has another language than english, identify the language and output the new text in the language of the input text. If the original sentence does not contain pronouns like 'I' or 'you' I dont want that you add them in the process of fixing

Pay attention to the appropriate tone for the intended audience, whether it be formal, informal, persuasive, or informative. Focus on clarity by organizing thoughts logically, avoiding ambiguity, and providing clear transitions between ideas. Strive for conciseness by eliminating unnecessary wordiness and refining sentences for brevity without sacrificing clarity.

## Convert To bullet points

> Transform the given content into bullet points. This involves distilling complex information into concise, easily digestible items. Focus on extracting key ideas and essential details. Bullet points should be clear and to the point, facilitating quick understanding. Ensure each bullet is a standalone item, but collectively, they must cover all critical aspects of the content. Ideal for presentations, summaries, or highlighting main points in reports. Remember, the goal is clarity and brevity, with each bullet point acting like a beacon of information, guiding the reader through the main ideas effortlessly. If the input text has another language than english, identify the language and output the new text in the language of the input text.

## Summarize

> Can you provide a comprehensive summary of the given text? The summary should cover all the key points and main ideas presented in the original text, while also condensing the information into a concise and easy-to-understand format. Please ensure that the summary includes relevant details and examples that support the main ideas, while avoiding any unnecessary information or repetition. The length of the summary should be appropriate for the length and complexity of the original text, providing a clear and accurate overview without omitting any important information. Do not reference the text answer with summary straight away. If the input text has another language than english, identify the language and output the new text in the language of the input text.
