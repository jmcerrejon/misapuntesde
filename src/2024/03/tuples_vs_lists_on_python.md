# Tuples Vs Lists on Python

![Tuples Vs Lists](/images/2024/03/tuples_vs_lists.jpg "Tuples Vs Lists")

**tuples** and **lists** are two types of data incorporated in _Python_ that are used to store collections of elements. Although they share some similarities, they also have key differences. Letâ€™s look at them:

- - -

1. **Changeability**:
    - **Tuples**: They are **immutable**, which means that once created, they cannot be modified. You cannot add, delete, or change items in a tuple after it is created.
    - **Lists**: They are **mutable**, allowing you to add, delete and modify items at any time.

2. **Syntax**:
    - **Tuples**: They are created by surrounding the elements in parentheses `()`.
    - **Lists**: Created using square brackets `[]`.

3. **Use of commas**:
    - **Tuples**: If you create a tuple with a single element, you must add a comma at the end. For example: `(28,)`.
    - **Lists**: You do not need to add a comma at the end when you create a list with a single element.

4. **Efficiency**:
    - **Tuples**: They are more efficient in terms of memory and performance than lists.
    - **Lists**: They can occupy more space and be less efficient due to their changeability.

So use **tuples or lists** depending on the changeability you need. Both have their specific use cases and can be useful in different situations.
