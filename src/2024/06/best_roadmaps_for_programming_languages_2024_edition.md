The best part that you are reading my blog is that I don't need to convince you with tons of resources like a dirty trickster to follow me. The resources I share with you are the best roadmaps for programming languages I found, now in 2024. Those are my personal preferences, and here are not all the language programming, only the ones I'm interested in according to my career, but I'm sure you will find them useful.

## Laravel

If you like _Laravel_, you probably follow _Povilas Korop_, the creator of _Laravel Daily_. He has a great roadmap for _Laravel_ and is very updated.

## PHP

For _PHP_, I recommend the roadmap from _PHP The ~~Right~~Wrong Way_. It's a very complete guide for beginners and advanced users. You have a lot of resources and tutorials to start with _PHP_, from the basics to the advanced.

## Front-End

I'm not like front-end, but as a freelance, I need to know the basics. I chose the roadmap from _geeksforgeeks_ because It's very complete and updated. Check the tutorials and resources they provide (very useful, but ssh!... Don't tell anyone).

They have a [MERN roadmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack-development-roadmap/) too, but I'm not a big fan of that stack. Maybe because I haven't used it yet. Do you recommend it?

## Open Source Guides

If you are interested in contributing to open-source projects, you should check the next guides. They have a lot of resources and guides: Starting an open source project, contributing, licensing, best practices, and more.

Coded with love by GitHub and friends.

## Developer roadmaps

If you are a developer, you should check the roadmap from [Kamran Ahmeds](https://kamranahmed.info/). It's a very complete guide for people like you. From role to basic & advanced skill.

Link: [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)

I will leave you with another great resource called _Exercism_: A platform that provides coding exercises for different programming languages. Practice your skills and learn new languages.

Link: [exercism.org](https://exercism.org)

## DSA

Too many devs always recommend learning Data Structures and Algorithms with the _Princeton University_ courses ([Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)). I'm not a big fan of that course and they are a bit boring.

If you are interested in this topic, you really should check the roadmap from [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-problems/). They have a lot of resources and tutorials with practical examples.

## Final thoughts

Being a developer or starting a new career in programming is a challenge. Sometimes you can feel overwhelmed, but with the right resources, you can achieve your goals.

I forgot to mention If you are a complete newbie, you should check the [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/0/) from Harvard University. It's a great course to start with the right foot.

I'm sure you will find this post useful. :smile:
