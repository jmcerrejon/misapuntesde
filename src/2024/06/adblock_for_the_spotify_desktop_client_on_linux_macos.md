# Adblock for the Spotify desktop client on Linux & macOS

I own a license of *Adguard* on *macOS* and I'm happy with it. It blocks ads on the *$potify desktop client*, but I don't know what's wrong lately: It doesn't work anymore. So I found a better approach to block ads on *$potify*. It's a simple solution that works on both *Linux* and *macOS*.

**TLD;DR:** Run on your terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://spotx-official.github.io/run.sh)
```

_Mmm, I don't trust you, Jose. What does it do?._

Good! Don't trust anyone. Here is the link to the repository:
