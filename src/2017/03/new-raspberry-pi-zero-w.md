# New Raspberry Pi Zero W

![0w](/images/2017/03/0w.png)

As far as I can read, few new hardware updates will come from the _Raspberry Pi Foundation_ in a couple of years, but yesterday we could see a slight renewal of one of the most popular boards due to its price: **Raspberry Pi Zero W now comes With WiFi + Bluetooth for about $10**...
