# New MAME releases for the Raspberry Pi

![comando_mame](/images/2017/03/comando_mame.png)

**UPDATE:** *MAME 0.183* with *gcc-6* **included in PiKISS** installation. It's a bit risky and takes quite a while to install dependencies, but in my initial tests, the operating system **remains stable**.

It seems *Shea Silverman* upload a [compiled version](http://blog.sheasilverman.com/2017/03/advancemame-3-4-for-the-raspberry-pi-zero/) for **Advance MAME (Pi Zero)**. That has made me visit the website of the official version, which since December last year has [official release for the Pi](http://www.advancemame.it/download), so we can enjoy the latest developments in this arcade machine emulator without having to compile it by ourselves.

In my case, I took advantage to include in the project [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS) not only *Advance MAME*, but also **MAME 0.183** compiled the last month by [choccyhobnob.com](http://choccyhobnob.com/mame-0-183-for-raspberry-pi-macos/), so you will not have to deal with any dependency to enjoy it. ~~I hope to update the script today. I'l having problems with GCC dependencies.~~

**QUESTION:** What do you think is the best emulator for *MAME*?
