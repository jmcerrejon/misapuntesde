# RPi Cam Web Interface

![surveillance](/images/2017/08/surveilance.jpg)

Very good project for those who have the *Raspi-Cam* and do not want headaches when it is displayed in a web interface. It has served me as a surveillance system for a few days. It has many options for timelapse, motion capture, etc ...

One note. To switch off the red led, edit the file */boot/config.txt* and add at the end:

```bash
disable_camera_led=1
```
