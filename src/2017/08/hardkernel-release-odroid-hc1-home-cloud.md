# Hardkernel release ODROID-HC1 Home Cloud

![odroid_stackable](/images/2017/08/odroid_stackable.png)

*ODROID-XU4* has a great octa-code, Gygabit and USB 3.0 among other wonderful features, that make it perfect for a system of storage in our *LAN*. Now we have a new board for the cloud called **ODROID-HC1** based on the design of the first one with a very competitive price. They have eliminated all the unnecessary to create a plate exclusive for the storage, so you will not be able to connect nothing by *HDMI, USB 3.0* (although it comes with *USB 2.0* connector, keep calm) or *eMMC*. We have a *SATA* to connect a hard drive and soon we will see his brother the *ODROID-HC2*, scheduled for November this year. Its price, *$49*.
