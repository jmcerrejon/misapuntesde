# Hardkernel release ODROID-HC1 Home Cloud

![odroid_stackable](/images/2017/08/odroid_stackable.png)

_ODROID-XU4_ has a great octa-code, Gygabit and USB 3.0 among other wonderful features, that make it perfect for a system of storage in our _LAN_. Now we have a new board for the cloud called **ODROID-HC1** based on the design of the first one with a very competitive price. They have eliminated all the unnecessary to create a plate exclusive for the storage, so you will not be able to connect nothing by _HDMI, USB 3.0_ (although it comes with _USB 2.0_ connector, keep calm) or _eMMC_. We have a _SATA_ to connect a hard drive and soon we will see his brother the _ODROID-HC2_, scheduled for November this year. Its price, _$49_.
