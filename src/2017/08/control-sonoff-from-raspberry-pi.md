# Control Sonoff from Raspberry Pi

![sonoff](/images/2017/08/sonoff.png)

Sonoff is a *WiFi* wireless switch that can connect to a wide range of home appliances. Out of the box, *Sonoff* transmits data to a cloud platform through the home *WiFi* router, which enables users to remotely control the connected appliances, via a mobile application called *eWeLink*.

*Sonoff* can also be used with an open source firmware called *ESP Easy. ESP Easy* allows users to fully configure Sonoff *(IP address, DNS, gateways, sensors, rules, etc...)* using a web interface. *Sonoff* with *ESP Easy* is becoming a very popular device for *DIY home* automation applications.
