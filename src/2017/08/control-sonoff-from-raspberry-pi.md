# Control Sonoff from Raspberry Pi

![sonoff](/images/2017/08/sonoff.png)

Sonoff is a _WiFi_ wireless switch that can connect to a wide range of home appliances. Out of the box, _Sonoff_ transmits data to a cloud platform through the home _WiFi_ router, which enables users to remotely control the connected appliances, via a mobile application called _eWeLink_.

_Sonoff_ can also be used with an open source firmware called _ESP Easy. ESP Easy_ allows users to fully configure Sonoff _(IP address, DNS, gateways, sensors, rules, etc...)_ using a web interface. _Sonoff_ with _ESP Easy_ is becoming a very popular device for _DIY home_ automation applications.
