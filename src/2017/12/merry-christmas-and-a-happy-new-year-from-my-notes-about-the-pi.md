# Merry Christmas and a happy new year from My notes about the Pi!

![merry_christmas_2017](/images/2016/12/merry_christmas_2016.png)

From here I send you my best wishes. I hope to come back to the normality in the blog again soon. What we are facing next year we do not know, but surely we will have to entertain and learn.
