# News this week in the Pi World

![rpi_xmas](/images/2017/12/rpi_xmas.png)

Yes, this week I'm here even if it's late, to bring you a ration of news from the **Pi World**. You bring the drink, don't you?...

* **Utiliser la camÃ©ra Pixy sur le Raspberry Pi (Fr):** I don't know French, and probably not you either, but looking at the images and reading the code we can see how using this camera will call Pixy to recognize objects, since it has a processor built in that takes care of this process and frees our CPU from analyzing the pixels. | [framboise314.fr](http://www.framboise314.fr/utiliser-la-camera-pixy-sur-le-raspberry-pi/)

![XU4Q](/images/2017/12/XU4Q.png)

* **Odroid XU4Q First Look And Emulation Test:** Well, this new XU4Q is no different from the existing *ODROID XU4*, but they mount a passive heatsink which is already a remarkable improvement. | [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3O3I_rovhU)

* **Is Vivaldi the Best Browser for Your Raspberry Pi?:** I haven't tried it yet, but I've read several articles commenting on how well *Vivaldi* is doing on *Raspberry Pi*. Have you tried it yet?. | [makeuseof.com](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/vivaldi-best-browser-raspberry-pi/)

![SparkyLinux_2](/images/2017/12/SparkyLinux_2.png)

* **SparkyLinux Operating System Launches for Raspberry Pi, Based on Debian Stretch:** Based on the latest Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" operating system, SparkyLinux 4.7 for ARMhf includes all the Raspberry Pi scripts and packages, and it's distributed in two flavors, a graphical version using the lightweight Openbox window manager and a text-based Lite edition that lets you customize the OS as you see fit. | [news.softpedia.com](http://news.softpedia.com/news/sparkylinux-operating-system-launches-for-raspberry-pi-based-on-debian-stretch-518966.shtml)

![eob_amiga](/images/2016/09/eob_amiga.png)

* **uae4arm by PandTomB:** I don't know how I found this repository, but they have a very optimized version of Amiga extracted from the *Pandora* console and adapted to the Pi. It's time to try it, isn't it? By the way, I have to compile and test Picodrive, which continues to improve and you can download the source code from [here](https://github.com/Chips-fr/picodrive-rpi). | [github.com > uae4arm](https://github.com/PandTomB/uae4arm)
