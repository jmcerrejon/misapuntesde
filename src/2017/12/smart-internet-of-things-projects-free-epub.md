I'm a bit lost completing projects before the end of the year, but today I wanted to take the opportunity to recommend this book thanks to *PacktPub*.

This book contains IoT projects such as building a smart temperature controller, creating your own vision machine project, building an autonomous mobile robot car, controlling IoT projects through voice commands, building IoT applications utilizing cloud technology and data science, and many more.
