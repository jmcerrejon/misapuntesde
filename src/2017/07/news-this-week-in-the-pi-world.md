# News this week in the Pi World

![rock64](/images/2017/07/rock64.png)

This same Monday, July 31, will begin distributing this board developed by the company [Pine64](https://www.pine64.org/), which already have a small market share with cheap and quality boards. You can choose the amount of *RAM* (from 1 to 4GB) and support *4K HDR10* thanks to its *Mali-450MP2*. While waiting for news about *Raspberry Pi 4*, let's review the best of the week in the **Pi World**.
