# BENJA based on Electron for Raspberry Pi and ODROID

![benja](/images/2017/07/benja.png)

**BENJA** stands for *Bootable Electron Node Js Application*. It is an operating system mounted over *Arch Linux* with software prepared to be used in *Kiosk* mode. It has pre-installed *Node.js*, *rasp-io* for access to in/out ports, in addition to [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five), which is no longer That a *framework* based on *Javascript* used for *robotics* and *IoT*.

It supports several boards, including *ODROID and Raspberry Pi*. The power that is giving many users with *HTML and JavaScript* knowledge to develop their own desktop applications thanks to [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/), makes it very easy to develop decent front ends. I encourage you to install it and if you want to learn a little more about *Electron*, [here](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-create-a-hello-world-app-using-electron) I leave you a free course developed by *Cameron Nokes* for the [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) platform.
