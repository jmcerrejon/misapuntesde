# BENJA based on Electron for Raspberry Pi and ODROID

![benja](/images/2017/07/benja.png)

**BENJA** stands for _Bootable Electron Node Js Application_. It is an operating system mounted over _Arch Linux_ with software prepared to be used in _Kiosk_ mode. It has pre-installed _Node.js_, _rasp-io_ for access to in/out ports, in addition to [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five), which is no longer That a _framework_ based on _Javascript_ used for _robotics_ and _IoT_.

It supports several boards, including _ODROID and Raspberry Pi_. The power that is giving many users with _HTML and JavaScript_ knowledge to develop their own desktop applications thanks to [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/), makes it very easy to develop decent front ends. I encourage you to install it and if you want to learn a little more about _Electron_, [here](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-create-a-hello-world-app-using-electron) I leave you a free course developed by _Cameron Nokes_ for the [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) platform.
