# News this week in the Pi World

Hi, I'm Jose Cerrejon and it's the year 2012. I'm here to tell you that I've started to collect links I'm finding about a board called _Raspberry Pi_ which is a computer with the size of a credit card and I'm sure will be talked about it for a long time. I am very excited and soon my board will arrive, although I don't know what I will do with it or the power actually have. If you want to access the document, you will find it in the following [link](https://goo.gl/Iwhbq). Thank you.

...

Hello, I am the same person but it has been a few years, we are in 2017 and I am making the competition to my alter ego that keeps insisting with its _Google Docs_. Seriously, is there no size limit for a document? There are already 52 pages of links and the guy is not bored. I keep putting the best links I've found this week about the _Pi_ and _ODROID_.
