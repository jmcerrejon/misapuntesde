# Lakka 2.0 stable release!

![Lakka 2](/images/2014/11/lakka.png)

A few days ago we have available a **new version of Lakka**, the image packaged with *LibreELEC + RetroArch* faster than existing today. Let's look at some of the most important features on this version 2.0 that **already offers support for the Raspberry Pi 0W and ODROID C2** ...

It has been a great effort after six months of development, to release this new version based on *LibreELEC* with almost all packages of emulators updated to the latest version. I highlight some of them:


* LibreELEC 8.0 stable rebase.

* RetroArch 1.5.0.

* Simplified menu.

* Intuitive netplay: you create or join netplay rooms directly from the menu.

* Ability to change the icon set on the fly.

* Revamped virtual keyboard.

* Almost all libretro cores are now enabled on every image.

* Important Vsync Bug fixed on Orange Pi.

* Fixed physical keyboard typing in the menu.

* Core updates include support for netplay and cheats.

* New renderers for PSX and N64 emulators.

* Updated controller support.

If you remember previous versions, we had to manually activate certain *cores or engines*. Well, now almost all are activated by default, and you have a few to not be bored: *EasyRPG (to play games created with RPG Maker), UAE4ARM, PUAE (another Amiga Emulator), CrocoDS (Amstrad CPC), VICE, PocketCDG Karaoke player), XRick, Frodo (Commodore 64), Mr.BOOM (bomberman clone) and bSNES (focuses on accuracy over performance)*.

What are you waiting for?.
