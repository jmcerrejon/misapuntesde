# Kodi's future

![kodi](/images/2017/06/kodi.png)

Last week there was a very controversial topic within the scene of this media player. The most famous *add-ons* to watch online TV channels, torrents and other content, **disappear without a trace**.

Of course they are an important part of Kodi, but it is not for what it was created. As I always say, as soon as one goes out the window, another comes in the door. I doubt it's the end of *Kodi*.

I wanted to open this post so you can comment on what you think about it. Do you use these add-ons?, Do you think that will get new versions of the already missing *Skynet, Flixnet, Genesis* and others?.
