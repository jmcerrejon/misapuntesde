# Automatic bartender

Today is my daughter Laura's birthday. The guests come, all prepared with music, food, fun assured, but... Someone will have to serve the drink, right?. Since *Siri* still has no arms, let's see how these guys have done in a curious *DIY at instructables.com...*

In order to make the cocktails, we have an *Android* application (source code included developed in *Xamarin*) that we will only have to modify with our preferences.

In the hardware side, an *Arduino Uno* will do the dirty work as you can see in the following capture:

Using a *MySQL* database, some *Python* code and a web server, we already have all the software we need in our Pi. We could also use another board as I have studied the project a bit.
