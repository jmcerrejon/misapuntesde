# Automatic bartender

![autom_bartender_02](/images/2017/05/autom_bartender_02.jpg)

Today is my daughter Laura's birthday. The guests come, all prepared with music, food, fun assured, but... Someone will have to serve the drink, right?. Since _Siri_ still has no arms, let's see how these guys have done in a curious _DIY at instructables.com..._

In order to make the cocktails, we have an _Android_ application (source code included developed in _Xamarin_) that we will only have to modify with our preferences.

In the hardware side, an _Arduino Uno_ will do the dirty work as you can see in the following capture:

Using a _MySQL_ database, some _Python_ code and a web server, we already have all the software we need in our Pi. We could also use another board as I have studied the project a bit.
