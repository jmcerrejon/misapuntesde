# Orange PI 2G-IOT for $10

![orange2g](/images/2017/04/orange2g.png)

New board to compete with low-cost ones like the _Pi Zero W_. These plates are proliferating because of their price and performance.

In this case, we find an _ARM Cortex-A5 32 bit - 1GHz with 256MB RAM_. The interesting thing is its connectivity: _WiFi, FM Radio_, **GSM / GPRS**, _GPIO_ compatible with RPi, _Bluetooth_... **All for 10 bucks**. What do you think?. As always, the community is the one that has to manifest and we will see if it supports it in its first steps of life.
