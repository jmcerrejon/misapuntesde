# Orange PI 2G-IOT for $10

![orange2g](/images/2017/04/orange2g.png)

New board to compete with low-cost ones like the *Pi Zero W*. These plates are proliferating because of their price and performance.

In this case, we find an *ARM Cortex-A5 32 bit - 1GHz with 256MB RAM*. The interesting thing is its connectivity: *WiFi, FM Radio*, **GSM / GPRS**, *GPIO* compatible with RPi, *Bluetooth*... **All for 10 bucks**. What do you think?. As always, the community is the one that has to manifest and we will see if it supports it in its first steps of life.
