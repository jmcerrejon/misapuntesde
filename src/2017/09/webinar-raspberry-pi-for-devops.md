# Webinar Raspberry Pi for Devops

![Keep Coding](/images/2017/09/RPi_20SEPT.png)

The day has come!. I am pleased to announce that I will develop together with the training course platform [Keep Coding](https://keepcoding.io), a **webinar about Raspberry Pi for spanish speakers**.

This webinar **will be online and free** for everyone through the *Keep Coding* platform and will be aimed at system administrators and developers in general. What we usually call *devops*. It will be something basic, although I've spent a lot of hours to get it right and we all learn to take advantage of that *Raspberry Pi* you have in a forgotten drawer. I will be accompanied by *Fernando Rodriguez* ([@frr149](https://twitter.com/frr149), co-founder of the platform and instructor.

Don't you have a Raspberry Pi? I can't believe it! But if that's your case, thanks to our sponsor and friend [raspipc.es](http://www.raspipc.es/public/home/) **we'll raffle a Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit** among all attendees via *Twitter*. To stay informed, you can follow my account at [@ulysess10](https://twitter.com/ulysess10) or [@KeepCoding_en](https://twitter.com/KeepCoding_en).

It will be the next **September 20th at 21:30**, Madrid time.

I leave you a calculator in case you are outside of Spain and want to know what time the event will be broadcast within your time zone:
