# News this week in the Pi World

![gesture](/images/2017/09/gesture.png)

The world of development boards is becoming increasingly competitive. We all know the situation and Eben doesn't seem to mind, as we won't see a new _Raspberry Pi_ for another year. Meanwhile, others are trying to take advantage of the situation, but it's very difficult to go against a community like the one with the Pi. Today we'll see some news on the subject along with others. Don't miss it in the weekly summary of the **Pi World**.

-   **Popular Raspberry Pi Clones:** Well, some corporations try to do something like Pi, and others directly try to clone them by improving some features. Here are the main ones. | [xenstreet.com](https://xenstreet.com/2017/09/26/popular-raspberry-pi-clones/)

-   **Raspberry Pi Zero W Simultaneous AP and Managed Mode Wifi:** Access points with _Hostapd and Dnsmasq_ and a pair of 0W. Great post, _Albert Chaharbakhshi_. | [albeec13.github.io](https://albeec13.github.io/2017/09/26/raspberry-pi-zero-w-simultaneous-ap-and-managed-mode-wifi/)

-   **How to install ExaGear Desktop Trial on Odroid:** We already have the possibility to test a _trial_ version before buying _Exagear Desktop for ODROID_, which is very good news for the owners of this board and if you are convinced, do not think about it and buy a license. | [eltechs.com](https://eltechs.com/exagear-desktop-trial-for-odroid/)

-   **Hand Gesture Recognition Using Python And OpenCV:** Gesture recognition interprets a series of movements to perform tasks and communicate with our machine more easily. _Python_ has good libraries and in this tutorial they use _OpenCV and Numpy_ to do it. | [codesquery.com](https://codesquery.com/gesture-recognition-using-python-opencv/)
