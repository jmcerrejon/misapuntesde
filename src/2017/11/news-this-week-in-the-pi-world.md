# News this week in the Pi World

![msx_book](/images/2017/11/msx_book.jpg)

This week I went to a hardware store to buy a light bulb. There I met an acquaintance from the neighborhood, no one with whom I have exchanged more than a couple of phrases in my life. And he said: *"Hey, the other day looking for a MSX emulator, I found your blog and I'm freak out when I saw it was yours!"*. Then we began to remember these days when you were a kid and you had all the time in front of your computer to play or program in *BASIC*.

These situations tell me I'm a few years old, yes. But I'm glad to know that there are people who read this blog near me. I see people from all over the world come to read *misapuntesde*, especially from the *USA*, so today I dedicate this **Pi World** to you, my dear reader. Open without knocking, it's always open...

* **Home automated terrarium/aquarium or other enclosed environment with a Raspberry Pi:** I've read it at [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/21/python-keeps-a-gecko-happy/) and it might be worth it to someone if they have a few bugs at home. Keep warning and make sure it's not a [Demodog](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=demodog+stranger+things&ia=web). | [github.com > TerrariumPI](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI)

![book3](/images/2017/11/book3.png)

* **The Official Raspberry Pi Projects Book 3:** This weekend you won't be bored reading everything that comes together in this new book as usual, free in pdf, although you can buy a print edition if you are interested. | [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/projects-3/)

![kali](/images/2017/11/kali.png)

* **Kali Linux 2017.3 disponible:** Updated to the latest version that includes new tools such as *InSpy* to search for people in *LinkedIn or OSRFramework* to list subdomains through 200 different services, among others utilities. | [offensive-security.com](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/)

![servo](/images/2017/11/servo.png)

* **Servo Controlled Time-Lapse Camera:** Let's recognize them. We were all gawking at each other looking at one or the other *time-lapse*. This project teaches us how to control a servo to include programmed camera rotation. | [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/gotfredsen/servo-controlled-time-lapse-camera-f7d81f)
