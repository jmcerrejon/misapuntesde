# espresso-arm: PID Espresso Controller + Siri

![expresso](/images/2016/06/expresso.png)

Projects where you join a bunch of technologies that seem so disparate, fascinate me. [Hallee](https://github.com/hallee) has been playing with his espresso and managed to make it work through _Siri_, hacking it with a _ODROID-C2_ (Although could also use any _SBC_).

As operating system, He used _Arch Linux_ and technologies we already know: _GPIO, Python_ and something I did not know: [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#adding-homebridge-to-ios) in a _Node.js server_ using _iOS HomeKit API_. All the details below.
