# espresso-arm: PID Espresso Controller + Siri

![expresso](/images/2016/06/expresso.png)

Projects where you join a bunch of technologies that seem so disparate, fascinate me. [Hallee](https://github.com/hallee) has been playing with his espresso and managed to make it work through *Siri*, hacking it with a *ODROID-C2* (Although could also use any *SBC*).

As operating system, He used *Arch Linux* and technologies we already know: *GPIO, Python* and something I did not know: [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#adding-homebridge-to-ios) in a *Node.js server* using *iOS HomeKit API*. All the details below.
