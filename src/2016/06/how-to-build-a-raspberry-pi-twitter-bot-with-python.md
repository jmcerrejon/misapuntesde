# How to Build a Raspberry Pi Twitter Bot with Python

![how-to-build-raspberry-pi-twitter-bot](/images/2016/06/how-to-build-raspberry-pi-twitter-bot.png)

With this simple tutorial, a little time and the *Raspberry Pi* (any board, indeed), you will learn how to create thanks to a *Python wrapper* for the *Twitter API* called **Twython**, a fantastic bot that post for you whatever you want. It is very easy to implement, really.

**PS:** Today is a special day: My daughter is 6 years. Laura, if one day you read this, from here I wish you an amazing day with your friends and family. We love you and we are very proud of you.
