# New Raspberry Pi 3 Model B out

![rpi3](/images/2016/02/rpi3.png)

Since last week, we have already a **brand new Raspberry Pi 3 Model B** that has hit the market with the same price of $35. What can we find in this version?. I put in bold changes regarding the *Raspberry Pi 2*...

![New Raspberry Pi 3](/images/2016/02/Raspberry_Pi_3_Large.jpg "New Raspberry Pi 3")

* SoC: **BCM2837** | BCM2836

* CPU: **Quad Cortex A53@1.2 GHz 64-bit** | Quad Cortex A7@1 GHz

* Instruction Set: **ARMv8-A** | ARMv7-A 

* GPU: **400 Mhz** (3D core to 300MHz) | 250MHz

* Wireless: **802.11n Wifi | Bluetooth 4.0**

Everything else has not changed. The backwards compatibility is complete. The *64-bit CPU* grant a superior performance (around a **50-60%**). There are competitors like *ODROID with 2GB of RAM, USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet*, but it seems the *Raspberry Pi Foundation* sees it unnecessary. What is your opinion?. I see you in the comments.
