# News this week in the Pi World

![netbeast_guys.jpg](/images/2016/02/netbeast_guys.jpg)

This week seems to have been dedicated to the world of video games. I was excited to spare some time to switch on my RPI and try several things that I were pending. Today I bring a very appetizing cocktail at this hour, I hope you enjoy it.

* **Netbeast:** I met this guys on the *Raspberry Jam* celebrated in *Barcelona in March, 2015*.  I have pending an article to talk about the benefits of this development platform for the *IoT*. Luis, If you came back to Huelva, just give me a call :) | [netbeast.co](https://netbeast.co/)

* **More games for our Raspberry Pi:** It is a seal of games that I remember with nostalgia, cause some of them came preinstalled on the first PC of my wife back in 2000. Apparently they will publish the catalog incrementally. | [webfootgames.com](http://www.webfootgames.com/pi/)

* **Resources for developers:** I liked this collection by *Rob Jones* where he plays various environments and plates for all tastes: *GPIO, Python, Scratch, Sonic Pi,...* | [robjonescowley.wordpress.com](https://robjonescowley.wordpress.com/resources/)

* **PiCore 7.0 released** I posted about it [here](/post.php?id=361) and [here](/post.php?id=362). It's an operating system that runs directly on *RAM*, consumes very few resources (really) and last month released version 7.0. | [forum.tinycorelinux.net](http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php/topic,19469.0.html)

* **Raspberry Pi Star Trek LCARS interface using PyGame:** I'm a *Star Trek* fan but not those that have been studied each chapter. I have not even seen many complete series except *The Next Generation*. One of the things that the people try to replicate over and over again, is the control panel or interface of the starship *Enterprise*. Here we have it so you can use it and it would be very original as home automation control panel, Don't you think?  | [github.com > rpi_lcars](https://github.com/tobykurien/rpi_lcars)
