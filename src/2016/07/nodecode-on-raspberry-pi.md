# NodeCode on Raspberry Pi

![LEDProgram](/images/2016/07/LEDProgram.png)

No, I have not become paranoid playing _Pokemon Go_ and I didn't take vacations. Development has taken the most part of my time and I want to leave everything ready before August. Today I took a spin around the Net and I have find the project _NodeCode_, a platform for "connecting things". They have focused on reducing the complexity of SBC connected together using a fairly easy to understand platform which is based on the union of nodes according to functionality.

This quick video shows how you can connect the pins on two different devices, in this case Raspberry Pis, to each other using connections made in software.

This is done with a _Raspberry Pi Model B_ and a _Raspberry Pi 2 Model B_ but these could be done with any other board.
