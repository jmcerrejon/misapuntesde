# News this week in the Pi World

![bartop_ferran](/images/2016/07/bartopferran.jpg)

First wanted to say thanks as always to the public that occasionally or not, has made this humble blog **exceeds 800,000 visits**. Thanks to you I'm still here. I'm not in the 95% of humanity that consumes content. I've dedicated some of my time to distribute or produce it. I will take a much needed vacation and will return soon. But first, I'm not going without throw you a few news directly to your occipital lobe. Come inside the post!
