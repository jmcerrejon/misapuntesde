# ChromiumOS for Raspberry Pi

![ChromiumOS](/images/2016/05/chromium_OS.png)

*Chromium OS* is an open-source project that aims to build an operating system that provides a fast, simple, and more secure computing experience for people who spend most of their time on the web.

*Dylan Callahan* brings version 0.5 of this project that aims to life in our small Raspberry Pi 2 or 3. According to the release note, although with limitations, it supports GPU partially, and no *WiFi* for the Pi 3. Not *Netflix* support yet.
