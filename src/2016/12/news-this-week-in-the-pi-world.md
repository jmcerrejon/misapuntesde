# News this week in the Pi World

![birthday_pi](/images/2016/12/birthday_pi.png)

We arrived at the end of 2016. Few surprises have given us with respect to this IoT world, but the projects created by the community are increasingly ambitious and at the same time easy to develop with time. Companies like* HardKernel* or *The Raspberry Pi foundation* make it easier our ideas to come to life. The good thing about these boards is, apart from their small dimensions, that high knowledge in electronics is not necessary.

Let's take a look at the best of the best in this week in the **Pi World** to finish the year... Go ahead!
