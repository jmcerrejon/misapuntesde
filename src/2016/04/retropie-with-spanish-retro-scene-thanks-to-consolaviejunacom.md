# RetroPie with Spanish Retro Scene thanks to consolaviejuna.com

I continue this week talking about emulators and games. This time with a curious project due its originality thanks to [@ConsolaViejuna](https://twitter.com/ConsolaViejuna/): **Script to set the current Spanish Retro Scene with RetroPie**. With this script, we can get *Spectrum, Amstrad emulators, Spanish Software* and so on, ready to play. Does it seem interesting initiative?. Well read on...

Just install typing the next commands with *RetroPie*:

```bash
cd $HOME/pi
git clone https://github.com/ConsolaViejuna/RetroPieScene.git
cd RetroPieScene
sudo ./RetroPie-scene_setup.sh
```
