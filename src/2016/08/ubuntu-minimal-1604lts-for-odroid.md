# Ubuntu Minimal 16.04LTS for ODROID

![ubuntu_minimal](/images/2016/08/ubuntu_minimal.png)

Return to work after a short break. Glad to know you are here again. I slowly waking up from this technological lethargy with a server version of _Ubuntu_ for the full range of _ODROID_ boards. Not many more details for now, but if you are planning to make a server with one of the boards from _Hardkernel_, this is your chance to try a new alternative.
