# Raspberry Pi Finder & PiBakery

![rPi Finder](/images/2016/08/rPiFinder.png)

We have two great desktop applications that will allow us to configure with little complication our RPIS:

* **Raspberry Fi Finder** Very useful when setting some parameters on your *Raspberry Pi* such as the *hostname, SSID* and password for your *WiFi* through *SSH*. Just connect your Pi via Ethernet to your network and this program will handle everything. Download link: [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/the-adafruit-raspberry-pi-finder?view=all)

* **PiBakery** is another tool to graphically configure the Pi with many interesting features: Download the latest version of *Raspbian*, *WiFi settings_, add functions in the first boot... I find it curious that the installer has a size of **1.4 Gb.** and once installed occupies  **4 Gb**. Link: [pibakery.org](http://www.pibakery.org/)
