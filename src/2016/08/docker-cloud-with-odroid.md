# Docker cloud with ODROID

![docker_odroid](/images/2016/08/docker_odroid.png)

**Still alive!**. This past week I have dedicated to give a facelift to the blog. I rewrote the backend using [laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework. To launch to the public I still have a little more time and improve some other section and refactorize all the code.

In the meantime, I leave you with a series of articles about building a **cloud with Docker using ODROID-C2**, but you can also use it with any other _SBC_. In this series of articles, It use 5 boards to made a Docker cluster where his author fight with multiple operating systems to find the right and compiles _Docker_ from the source. Very interesting.
