# News last week in the Pi World

![wayland_qt](/images/2016/03/wayland_qt.png)

Now I'm back from my vacation and I wish to do/learn new things. The Pi World has not stopped turning, so we'll check links of everything that happened last week on the plates with the size of a credit card. Remember that I also expanding links in my _Google Docs_ about the Pi [here](https://goo.gl/Iwhbq)... Let's go!
