# RaspArch y RaspEX: OS adapted to the brand new Raspberry Pi 3

![RaspArch](/images/2016/03/rasparch-logo.png)


I think except [once here](/post.php?id=547), I have never commented operating systems that is building *Exton* for* Raspberry Pi 2/3*. They are *Debian-based Ubuntu + (RaspEx)* and *ArchLinux (RaspArch)*.

- - -
*RaspArch* comes preinstalled with *LXDE, Firefox and GIMP* already configured, which is appreciated for those who have no desire to fight with a distro like *Arch Linux*, for me the most powerful and fastest today.

*RaspEX* is an operating system for *Raspberry Pi* based on *Debian (8.3) and Ubuntu (15.10)*. Share desktop with his brother *RaspArch* with *Kernel 4.1.18*
