# RaspArch y RaspEX: OS adapted to the brand new Raspberry Pi 3

![RaspArch](/images/2016/03/rasparch-logo.png)

I think except [once here](/post.php?id=547), I have never commented operating systems that is building _Exton_ for* Raspberry Pi 2/3*. They are _Debian-based Ubuntu + (RaspEx)_ and _ArchLinux (RaspArch)_.

---

_RaspArch_ comes preinstalled with _LXDE, Firefox and GIMP_ already configured, which is appreciated for those who have no desire to fight with a distro like _Arch Linux_, for me the most powerful and fastest today.

_RaspEX_ is an operating system for _Raspberry Pi_ based on _Debian (8.3) and Ubuntu (15.10)_. Share desktop with his brother _RaspArch_ with _Kernel 4.1.18_
