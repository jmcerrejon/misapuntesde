# ODROID-C2

![ODROID-C2](/images/2016/02/ODROID_C2.png)

Today I want to talk about the new board developed by the _Hardkernel's guys_. The day of **shipment date is Wednesday, March 4**. Let's take a look at its features after the jump.

---

-   **Amlogic ARM Cortex-A53(ARMv8) 2Ghz quad core CPUs**

-   Mali-450 GPU (3 Pixel-processors + 2 Vertex shader processors)

-   **2 Gb DDR3 SDRAM**

-   **Gigabit Ethernet**

-   HDMI 2.0 4K/60Hz display

-   H.265 4K/60FPS and H.264 4K/30FPS capable VPU

-   40pin GPIOs + 7pin I2S

-   **eMMC5.0 HS400 Flash Storage slot** / UHS-1 SDR50 MicroSD Card slot

-   USB 2.0 Host x 4, USB OTG x 1 (power + data capable)

-   Infrared(IR) Receiver

-   Ubuntu 16.04, **Android 5.1 Lollipop** (Kernel 3.14 LTS), Fedora, ARCHLinux, Debian, OpenELEC

The different benchmarks that are being made to these processors, they largely positive results. It also should be noted that operating systems are not ready for these processors, but it will be a matter of months that will improve their compatibility and stability.

**NOTE:** The price of the **C1+ is now $32**.

In conclusion, I think the _PI3_ has generated enough _hype_ and for a better performance (not as much as proclaim as I read), not worth the change if you own an older model. _HardKernel_ should lower the price of shipping costs somehow. I think it's the only way to reach a wider audience and maintain a community as strong as has its direct competitor.
