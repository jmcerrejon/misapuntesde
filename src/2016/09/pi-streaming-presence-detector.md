# Pi Streaming Presence Detector

![presence](/images/2016/09/presence.png)

When I was working in a office, I thought of a system for monitoring and to know where ~~the hell~~ my boss was. This hosted project on Github uses a *Pi Zero* to know a MAC localization. It use *Arp* to scan and locate *IPs* and the platform [Initial state](https://initialstate.com/) to monitoring data visually. As a programming language, *Python*.
