# Indoor tracking using 4G and A-GPS mode

![agps](/images/2016/09/agps.png)

4G networks will be a standard soon. Mode *A-GPS* was created by *Nokia* to avoid having to wait to see what we have satellites hovering above our heads in an initial process called **TTFF** (*Time To First Fix*). That's why the *GPS* cars without internet take longer to know this information. It's not the case of your smartphone which makes a request over the Internet via *HTTP* according to your location.

The *cooking-hacks* guys have created a great tutorial based on *GPS Shield* sell in their store, but perhaps we can achieve the same result in some other way or other shield.
