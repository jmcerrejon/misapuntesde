# Xump for Raspberry Pi

![xump](/images/2016/09/xump.png)

*Xump* is a puzzle game developed in 2005 but has been improving these years thanks to its developers. It has versions for almost every platform imaginable, and among them is the *Raspberry Pi*.

I didn't read the story, but hey, the mechanism is very simple and does not require any knowledge, so if you want to spare your time with an addictive game, this is for you. I have also added to the list of games [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS). I leave you with the trailer and the download link:
