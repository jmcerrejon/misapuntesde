# 60 core Raspberry Pi 2 Cluster-in-a-box

![cluster_in_a_Box](/images/2016/01/cluster_in_a_Box.jpg)

Through a _Slack_ channel commented to me about this project did not know and that I was surprised by their appearance. A user has pluged in no more and no less than 15 **Raspberry Pi** in this monstrous box with which you can invoke [Arioch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_in_the_Elric_series).

The premise, as their author said, is create a portable, self contained cluster of computers that only requires a single power cable and an Ethernet uplink cable to operate.

The hardware:

-   1x Cheap toolbox from Home Depot

-   15x Raspberry Pi 2 Computer boards (1GB RAM ea.)

-   15x 16GB class 10 MicroSD cards

-   Ubuntu 14.04 LTS image loaded on each

-   300W SilverStone SFX power supply

-   Netgear 16 port Gigabit switch

-   120mm Noctua Fan

-   Arduino Pro driving gratuitous power LEDs up top

With 15 Raspberry Pis and 4 cores for each one, I'm pretty sure you can perform these tasks with costs us hours. More details on the following link.
