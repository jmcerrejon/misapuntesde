# OpenELEC ended his development?

![OpenElec](/images/2015/11/openelec6.png)

If ye have not noticed, we have no new version for half a year. I was reading today at [lakka.tv](https://www.lakka.tv/articles/2016/08/23/lakka-update-including-retroarch-136/) and I could not believe it, but it seems the development of one of the best MediaCenter could come to an end. Or not?...

While the website [openelec.tv](https://openelec.tv/news) is not updated since May, there is no official confirmation perhaps because the partners supporting of the project.

What if we go to Github account?. It remains active. Commits are continuous, so do not know if the code being debugged or not before taking a new release...

Anyway, we have an alternative called [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv) has now released its version _7.90.006_. Although is an _Alpha_ version, behaves very stably and is based on _Kodi v17.0-beta2_.
