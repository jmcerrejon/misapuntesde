# MAME 0.177 for Raspberry Pi

![mame](/images/2016/10/mame.png)

_Steve_ is a British guy who now lives in _USA_. We have common hobbies: _Macs and Raspberry Pi_. Testing new alternatives to _mame4allpi_, I have encountered his binary based on the latest version _0.177_, which I've tested and is fabulous in the new _RPi3_, especially in support _ROM_ not supported by _mame4allpi_ whose code is based on version _0.127b5_.
