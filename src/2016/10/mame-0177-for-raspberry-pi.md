# MAME 0.177 for Raspberry Pi

![mame](/images/2016/10/mame.png)

*Steve* is a British guy who now lives in *USA*. We have common hobbies: *Macs and Raspberry Pi*. Testing new alternatives to *mame4allpi*, I have encountered his binary based on the latest version *0.177*, which I've tested and is fabulous in the new *RPi3*, especially in support *ROM* not supported by *mame4allpi* whose code is based on version *0.127b5*.
