# openMSX 0.13.0 for Raspberry Pi

![msx](/images/msx.png)

[Patrick](https://www.msx.org/wiki/Patrick_van_Arkel), member from [openMSX Team](https://www.msx.org/wiki/Team_openMSX) has invited me to compile and prepare a binary for the community. So here I leave it for _Raspberry Pi_. It's version _0.13.0_ and if you choose to install from [PiKISS](https://github.com/jmcerrejon/PiKISS/blob/b04c1b058b66c68f7552d4f5a22fc63e381a19a1/scripts/emus/msx.sh) will be able to choose to install the binary or automatically compile it (it takes about 50 minutes, so be patient). I leave you with the link to the binary and another surprise ...

**EXTRA!:** If you install from _PiKISS_ also have other advantages:

-   Add _Homebrew_ game called _Uridium_.

-   Optimize the emulator through the file _settings.xml_ which is automatically installed.

I want to thank _Patrick_ for helping me with the script when I was solving a problem with the compiler.
